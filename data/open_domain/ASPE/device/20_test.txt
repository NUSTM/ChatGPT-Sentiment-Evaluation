it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .####[['play', 'negative']]
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['looks', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive']]

the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .####[['folders', 'negative']]
