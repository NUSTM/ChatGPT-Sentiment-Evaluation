well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .####[['of', 'negative']]
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
* software is absolutely terrible :####[['software', 'negative']]
- best in class sound####[['sound', 'positive']]
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .####[['internet functions', 'negative']]
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .####[['user interface', 'negative']]

this phone is highly recommended otherwise .####[['phone', 'positive']]
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .####[['play', 'negative']]
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['looks', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive']]
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .####[['remote', 'negative'], ['use', 'negative']]
i am quite happy with the camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .####[['folders', 'negative']]
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .####[['equipment', 'positive']]
- the software that came with it was tough to load .####[['software', 'negative'], ['load', 'negative']]
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .####[['sounds', 'positive']]
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####[['lense cap', 'positive']]
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####[['unresponsiveness', 'negative']]
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .####[['customer service dept', 'negative']]
