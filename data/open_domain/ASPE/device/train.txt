the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .####[['cover', 'negative']]
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .####[['id3 tags', 'positive']]
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .####[['scroll wheel', 'positive']]
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !####[['cd', 'positive'], ['dvd', 'negative'], ['picture', 'negative']]
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .####[['software problem', 'negative']]
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .####[['zen', 'positive']]
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .####[['remove', 'positive'], ['front plate', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive']]
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .####[['photo quality', 'positive'], ['prints', 'positive']]
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !####[['camera', 'positive']]
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####[['identifying', 'negative']]
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on####[['software', 'negative'], ['operate', 'negative']]
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .####[['headphone jack', 'negative']]
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .####[['apex product', 'negative']]
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .####[['hidden features', 'positive']]
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck####[['headphones', 'negative']]
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .####[['value', 'positive']]
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .####[['player', 'positive']]
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .####[['macro', 'positive'], ['auto mode', 'positive']]
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .####[['mediasource organizer', 'positive']]
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .####[['dvd player', 'positive'], ['design', 'positive'], ['works', 'positive']]
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####[['machines', 'positive'], ['quality', 'negative']]
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .####[['mediasource software', 'negative']]
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .####[['buttons', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['navigate', 'positive']]
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !####[['headphones', 'negative'], ['sound quality', 'positive']]
great colors , pictures and white balance .####[['white balance', 'positive']]
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .####[['speakerphone', 'positive'], ['currency converter', 'positive'], ['stopwatch', 'positive']]
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .####[['sound', 'positive']]
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .####[['progressive scan option', 'positive'], ['remote control', 'positive']]
i just bought this player today and i already love it .####[['player', 'positive']]
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .####[['3x optical zoom', 'negative']]
either way , can 't go wrong with this price .####[['price', 'positive']]
door broke after a month .####[['door', 'negative']]
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .####[['firmware', 'negative'], ['os', 'negative']]
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !####[['camera', 'positive']]
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .####[['panel', 'negative']]
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .####[['music', 'positive']]
the camera has a wonderful set of features .####[['set', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
some dvd 's i rented would not play .####[['dvd', 'negative'], ['play', 'negative']]
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .####[['price', 'positive'], ['size', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .####[['controls', 'positive'], ['manual', 'positive']]
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .####[['continuous shot mode', 'positive']]
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .####[['design', 'positive']]
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####[['speed', 'negative']]
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .####[['volume level', 'negative']]
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .####[['setup', 'positive'], ['fiddling', 'positive']]
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .####[['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .####[['memory', 'positive']]
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .####[['high resolution screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive'], ['backlight', 'positive']]
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['software', 'positive'], ['casing', 'positive']]
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .####[['mp3 player', 'positive'], ['software', 'negative']]
the software sucks .####[['software', 'negative']]
for the price it is a well spent investment !####[['price', 'positive']]
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####[['case', 'positive']]
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !####[['quality', 'positive'], ['pictures', 'positive']]
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .####[['pics', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive']]
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####[['zx', 'positive']]
then sorting the files is easy as pie .####[['sorting', 'positive'], ['files', 'positive']]
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####[['price', 'positive']]
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####[['size', 'positive'], ['durability', 'negative']]
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .####[['rip', 'positive']]
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display####[['screen', 'negative'], ['read', 'negative']]
other than that this thing is great ...####[['thing', 'positive']]
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )####[['size', 'positive']]
you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .####[['song', 'positive']]
apex sucks !####[['apex', 'negative']]
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .####[['use', 'positive']]
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
great screen and great sound .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .####[['g3 raw image software', 'negative']]
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .####[['photo quality', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .####[['player user interface', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['navigation', 'positive']]
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####[['headphone jack failure', 'negative']]
for the price and features it is really good .####[['price', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####[['remote', 'negative']]
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .####[['menus', 'negative'], ['functions', 'negative']]
video output stopped workin .####[['video output', 'negative']]
the sound quality is very good .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
otherwise , this player is awesome !####[['player', 'positive']]
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####[['menu options', 'negative']]
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .####[['mp3 player', 'positive']]
made the camera totally inoperable .####[['camera', 'negative']]
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .####[['download', 'positive']]
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !####[['camera', 'positive']]
but , i would definately recommend this phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .####[['hear', 'positive']]
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .####[['learn', 'positive']]
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .####[['sound quality', 'negative']]
in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .####[['artist', 'positive'], ['album', 'positive'], ['folders', 'negative']]
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .####[['affordability', 'positive']]
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .####[['use', 'positive']]
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####[['reception', 'negative']]
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .####[['use', 'positive']]
- well-backlit keypad####[['keypad', 'positive']]
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .####[['play', 'positive'], ['dvd-r', 'positive']]
i am really impressed by this dvd player .####[['dvd player', 'positive']]
battery life is ok .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####[['case', 'negative']]
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####[['apex', 'positive'], ['quality brand', 'positive']]
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .####[['30gb zen xtra', 'positive']]
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .####[['instructions', 'negative']]
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####[['4mp', 'positive']]
great feature list , poor reliability .####[['feature list', 'positive'], ['reliability', 'negative']]
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .####[['buttons', 'positive'], ['interface', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .####[['running', 'positive'], ['dvds', 'positive']]
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .####[['dynamic playlists', 'negative'], ['menus', 'negative'], ['get', 'negative'], ['operate', 'negative']]
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####[['key arrangement', 'negative'], ['shapes', 'negative']]
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !####[['camera', 'positive']]
creative software stinks .####[['software', 'negative']]
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .####[['play modes', 'positive']]
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####[['name', 'negative']]
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .####[['zen manual', 'negative']]
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['images', 'positive']]
do n't buy this player .####[['player', 'negative']]
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .####[['transfer cable', 'negative']]
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.####[['looks', 'negative'], ['play', 'negative']]
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .####[['speakerphone', 'positive'], ['radio', 'positive']]
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####[['finish', 'positive']]
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .####[['instructions', 'negative']]
overall , a good buy for the price .####[['price', 'positive']]
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####[['t-zones', 'negative']]
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['carry', 'positive']]
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .####[['price-wise zens', 'positive']]
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####[['sound', 'positive']]
it was no problem for me to use their software .####[['software', 'positive']]
will never purchase apex again .####[['apex', 'negative']]
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .####[['software', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .####[['battery life', 'negative']]
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .####[['memory', 'positive']]
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .####[['earbuds', 'positive']]
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.####[['closeup mode', 'positive'], ['rechargable battery', 'positive']]
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .####[['mechanics', 'negative']]
silverish color really adds a special touch .####[['silverish color', 'positive']]
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .####[['battery charging system', 'positive']]
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !####[['player', 'positive']]
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####[['build quality', 'negative'], ['face plate', 'negative']]
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['voice dialing', 'negative']]
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .####[['sound level', 'negative']]
that 's a rare and valuable feature .####[['feature', 'positive']]
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .####[['memory', 'positive']]
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .####[['mediasource', 'positive'], ['load', 'positive']]
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking####[['voice activated dialing', 'negative']]
it also has unproven battery life .####[['battery life', 'negative']]
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .####[['range', 'positive'], ['formats', 'positive']]
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####[['raw format', 'positive'], ['post-processing flexibility', 'positive']]
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .####[['mms technology', 'positive']]
very bad quality .####[['quality', 'negative']]
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .####[['product support', 'negative']]
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####[['scroll button', 'negative']]
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .####[['operating system', 'negative']]
3 ) user replaceable battery####[['battery', 'positive']]
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####[['lip-sync issue', 'negative']]
this thing seriously is a good player though .####[['player', 'positive']]
one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .####[['scroll', 'negative']]
the battery recharges real fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .####[['battery recharges', 'positive']]
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .####[['product', 'positive']]
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .####[['id3 tags', 'negative']]
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .####[['phone', 'positive']]
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .####[['mp3 player', 'positive']]
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####[['face-plate', 'negative']]
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .####[['stitch pictures feature', 'positive']]
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .####[['leather pouch', 'positive']]
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .####[['autofocus', 'negative']]
* slick-looking design and improved interface####[['design', 'positive'], ['interface', 'positive']]
one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !####[['screen', 'negative']]
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .####[['data storage device', 'negative']]
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .####[['remote', 'negative']]
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .####[['eax', 'positive']]
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####[['recharge', 'negative'], ['usb recharging', 'negative']]
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .####[['dvds', 'negative'], ['play', 'negative']]
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .####[['remote control', 'negative']]
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .####[['picture quality', 'positive'], ['outdoor settings', 'positive']]
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['light', 'positive'], ['music transfer', 'positive'], ['controls', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive'], ['equilizer', 'positive']]
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .####[['voice dialing', 'negative']]
only con i can think of is no camera ... .####[['camera', 'negative']]
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .####[['nomad jukebox', 'positive']]
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####[['sound', 'positive']]
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .####[['player works', 'positive'], ['looks', 'positive']]
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .####[['radio', 'positive']]
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .####[['manage', 'positive'], ['change', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive']]
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .####[['non-slr digital camera', 'positive']]
the price / performance looked just right .####[['price', 'positive'], ['performance', 'positive']]
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )####[['environmental audio', 'negative'], ['sound', 'negative']]
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .####[['4300', 'positive'], ['nikon', 'positive']]
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .####[['read', 'negative']]
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .####[['access', 'negative'], ['menus', 'negative'], ['dvds', 'negative']]
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .####[['mp3 players', 'positive'], ['sound quality', 'positive']]
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['power output', 'positive']]
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .####[['40gb nomad zen xtra', 'positive']]
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .####[['shots', 'negative']]
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .####[['body construction', 'negative']]
usb 2.0 - very fast####[['usb 2.0', 'positive']]
the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .####[['build quality', 'positive'], ['playing discs', 'positive'], ['picture', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####[['freezing', 'negative']]
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .####[['buttons', 'negative']]
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####[['delete', 'positive']]
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####[['phone', 'positive']]
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####[['change genre', 'negative'], ['album', 'negative'], ['track information', 'negative']]
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .####[['software', 'positive'], ['mp3 player', 'positive']]
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .####[['picture', 'negative']]
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .####[['rate plans', 'positive']]
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !####[['apex dvd player', 'positive']]
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####[['pop-off face', 'negative']]
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .####[['player', 'positive']]
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .####[['picture quality', 'positive'], ['durability', 'positive']]
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .####[['spare battery', 'negative']]
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####[['navigation', 'positive'], ['syncing files', 'positive']]
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .####[['calendar', 'positive']]
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .####[['t-mobile', 'negative']]
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .####[['player', 'negative']]
there was neither picture nor sound .####[['picture', 'negative'], ['sound', 'negative']]
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####[['product', 'positive']]
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .####[['remote', 'negative'], ['buttons', 'negative']]
* main dial is not backlit .####[['dial', 'negative']]
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !####[['nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb', 'positive']]
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .####[['highest optical zoom pictures', 'positive']]
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .####[['cut-outs', 'negative'], ['controls', 'negative']]
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .####[['sound settings', 'positive']]
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .####[['movie clips', 'negative']]
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .####[['unit', 'negative'], ['recognize', 'negative'], ['play', 'negative']]
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .####[['focusing system', 'positive']]
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####[['hard drive', 'negative']]
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####[['size', 'positive']]
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .####[['front cover', 'negative'], ['feels', 'negative']]
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .####[['online print ordering', 'positive']]
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .####[['software', 'positive'], ['filing system', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .####[['indoor setting', 'negative']]
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .####[['earpiece', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####[['price', 'positive']]
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .####[['bookmarks', 'negative']]
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .####[['making playlists', 'negative']]
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .####[['speaker phone', 'positive'], ['radio', 'positive'], ['infrared', 'positive']]
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .####[['video formats', 'positive']]
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !####[['i/p button', 'positive']]
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .####[['speaker phone', 'positive']]
seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .####[['dvds', 'negative'], ['music cds', 'negative'], ['loading', 'negative'], ['no disc', 'negative']]
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !####[['resolution digital camera', 'positive']]
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .####[['sounds', 'positive'], ['line out jack', 'negative']]
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .####[['eax mode', 'positive']]
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .####[['power button', 'negative'], ['external display', 'negative'], ['read', 'negative']]

the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .####[['organizer software', 'positive']]
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).####[['transfer songs', 'negative']]

for the money apex machines have good features .####[['features', 'positive']]
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .####[['volume range', 'positive']]

recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .####[['g3', 'positive']]
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####[['signal quality', 'positive'], ['signal', 'positive'], ['reception', 'positive']]
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .####[['control', 'positive'], ['mode', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .####[['sound', 'positive']]
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .####[['dvd', 'negative'], ['freeze', 'negative']]
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .####[['8mb', 'negative']]
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .####[['tagging process', 'negative'], ['interacts', 'negative']]
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .####[['phone', 'positive']]
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .####[['appearance', 'positive']]
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .####[['dvd player', 'positive'], ['case', 'positive']]

transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .####[['transfers', 'positive']]
this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !####[['phone', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['ergonomics', 'positive']]

i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .####[['volume level', 'negative']]
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####[['reception', 'positive'], ['customization', 'positive'], ['applications', 'positive']]
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .####[['playlists', 'negative']]
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .####[['use', 'positive'], ['laid out', 'positive']]
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !####[['sounds', 'positive'], ['picture clarity', 'negative']]
can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .####[['read dvd', 'negative'], ['vcd', 'negative']]
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .####[['sync', 'positive']]
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['options', 'positive'], ['power', 'positive']]

the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .####[['picture', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .####[['case', 'positive']]
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .####[['product', 'negative']]
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .####[['use', 'positive']]
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .####[['motor', 'negative'], ['eject', 'negative']]
learning how to use it will not take very long .####[['learning', 'positive']]
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .####[['software', 'positive'], ['defaults genres', 'positive']]
battery life is good for a phone of this size .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####[['looking', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive']]

the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .####[['color screen', 'positive'], ['ringtones', 'positive']]
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .####[['focusing', 'negative'], ['low light', 'negative']]
first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most aesthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .####[['looking player', 'negative']]
this camera has a major design flaw .####[['design', 'negative']]
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .####[['cd burner', 'negative']]
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .####[['customer service dept', 'negative']]
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .####[['player', 'positive']]
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !####[['at&t customer service', 'negative']]
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !####[['battery', 'negative']]
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .####[['replaceable battery', 'positive']]
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .####[['lens', 'positive'], ['picture quality', 'positive']]
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .####[['dvds', 'positive'], ['play', 'positive']]
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .####[['navigation', 'positive']]
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####[['photo quality', 'positive']]

i love this player .####[['player', 'positive']]

if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .####[['software', 'positive'], ['access', 'positive']]
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .####[['looks', 'positive']]
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .####[['radio', 'positive'], ['reception', 'positive']]
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .####[['size', 'positive'], ['design', 'positive'], ['imo looking', 'positive']]
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .####[['qualities', 'positive'], ['picture', 'positive']]
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .####[['design', 'positive'], ['construction', 'positive']]

i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .####[['installing', 'negative']]
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
also , the instruction manual is very bad .####[['instruction manual', 'negative']]
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .####[['structured', 'positive'], ['buttons', 'positive']]
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .####[['feels', 'negative']]
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .####[['reception', 'positive'], ['sound quality', 'positive']]
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .####[['software', 'positive']]
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .####[['speakerphone', 'positive']]
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####[['look', 'negative']]
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####[['price', 'positive'], ['quality', 'negative']]
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .####[['construction', 'negative']]
i will never buy a creative product again .####[['creative product', 'negative']]
* removable battery####[['battery', 'positive']]
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####[['depth', 'positive'], ['field', 'positive']]
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit####[['musicmatch software', 'positive']]
do n't buy this player .####[['player', 'negative']]
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .####[['video', 'negative'], ['features', 'negative']]
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['basic features', 'positive']]
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .####[['phone', 'positive']]
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####[['download', 'negative']]
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####[['freezes', 'negative']]
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .####[['battery recharge', 'positive']]
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####[['performance', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .####[['player', 'negative']]
once again , the sound is awesome , the batter life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'negative']]
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .####[['power supply', 'negative']]
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .####[['eax equalizer', 'negative']]
2 ) scroll button / switch####[['scroll button', 'negative']]
audio on video also lacking .####[['audio', 'negative']]
the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . ####[['sync', 'negative']]
only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .####[['accessories', 'negative']]
the door would not close .####[['door', 'negative']]
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive'], ['light', 'positive']]
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the software failed repeatedly .####[['software', 'negative']]
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .####[['control', 'negative']]
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?####[['lag', 'negative']]
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .####[['customer service reps', 'negative']]
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####[['amazon', 'positive']]
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .####[['controls', 'negative'], ['use', 'negative']]
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .####[['design', 'positive'], ['color screen', 'positive'], ['resolution', 'positive']]
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .####[['find', 'negative'], ['online support', 'negative']]
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .####[['progressive scan player', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####[['customer service', 'negative']]
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .####[['battery', 'positive']]
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .####[['auto', 'positive'], ['manual', 'positive']]
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .####[['battery', 'positive']]
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !####[['headphones', 'negative']]
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .####[['universal remote control', 'negative']]
unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . "####[['player', 'negative']]
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####[['firmware', 'positive']]
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .####[['play windows media', 'negative'], ['divx rips', 'negative']]
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####[['silver plate', 'negative']]
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .####[['headphone earbuds', 'positive']]
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####[['ripping cds', 'positive']]
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .####[['screen', 'positive']]
the menus are very easy to navigate .####[['menus', 'positive'], ['navigate', 'positive']]
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .####[['zoom lens unit', 'negative']]
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive####[['battery life', 'negative'], ['operators manual', 'negative'], ['software lockups', 'negative'], ['replacement battery', 'negative']]
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !####[['camera', 'positive']]
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .####[['sound', 'negative'], ['volume', 'negative']]
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .####[['value', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical####[['locations', 'negative'], ['buttons', 'negative']]
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .####[['battery', 'positive']]
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .####[['top', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative']]
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['see', 'positive'], ['colors', 'positive']]
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .####[['controls', 'negative'], ['use', 'negative'], ['software tagging system', 'negative']]
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['ring tones', 'positive']]
the remote is a little hard to understand .####[['remote', 'negative'], ['understand', 'negative']]
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .####[['phone', 'positive']]
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .####[['unit', 'positive']]
it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .####[['earbuds', 'negative']]
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .####[['interface', 'positive']]
8 battery life is excellent .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .####[['servicing', 'negative']]

also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####[['feature', 'negative']]
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .####[['cds', 'negative']]
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .####[['use', 'positive'], ['form factor', 'positive'], ['looks', 'positive']]
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .####[['formats', 'positive']]
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .####[['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .####[['network coverage', 'negative'], ['network', 'negative']]
the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .####[['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
the quality is superb . ####[['quality', 'positive']]
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .####[['picture', 'negative']]
for the most part this is a good dvd player .####[['dvd player', 'positive']]
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .####[['headphone', 'negative']]
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.####[['camera', 'positive']]
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .####[['id3 tags', 'negative']]
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !####[['plays', 'positive'], ['media', 'positive']]
ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .####[['ripping', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .####[['construction quality', 'negative'], ['product support', 'negative'], ['scroll wheel', 'negative'], ['headphone jack', 'negative']]
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .####[['software', 'negative']]
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .####[['remote', 'positive'], ['designed', 'positive']]
2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .####[['scroll button', 'negative'], ['select', 'negative']]
this is a great camera for you !####[['camera', 'positive']]
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .####[['fm radio', 'positive']]
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####[['menus', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive'], ['manipulate', 'positive'], ['access', 'positive']]
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .####[['look', 'positive'], ['build', 'positive'], ['form', 'positive'], ['face plate', 'positive']]
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .####[['software', 'positive']]
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .####[['software', 'negative']]
the features are really cool like the radio .####[['radio', 'positive']]
my only significant complaint is sound quality .####[['sound quality', 'negative']]
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####[['features', 'positive']]
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .####[['lens viewfinder', 'negative'], ['lcd viewfinder', 'positive']]
only if we could get one camera in it . .####[['camera', 'negative']]
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .####[['volume', 'positive']]
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .####[['reception', 'positive']]
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .####[['case', 'negative']]
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['sound adjustments', 'positive']]
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .####[['player', 'positive']]
the volume .####[['volume', 'negative']]
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )####[['picture', 'negative']]
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well####[['cover', 'negative'], ['fit', 'negative']]
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .####[['player', 'positive']]
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . ####[['ringer', 'positive']]
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .####[['case', 'negative']]
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####[['read', 'negative'], ['dvds', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative']]
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !####[['camera', 'positive']]
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "####[['screen freezes', 'negative']]
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .####[['mp3 player', 'positive']]
their customer service is very poor .####[['customer service', 'negative']]
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .####[['portable player', 'negative'], ['feel', 'negative']]
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .####[['feel', 'negative'], ['layout', 'negative'], ['remote control', 'negative'], ['filenames', 'negative'], ['mp3s', 'negative']]
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .####[['infrared', 'positive']]
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .####[['use', 'positive']]
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .####[['program', 'negative']]
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .####[['software', 'positive']]
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .####[['battery', 'positive']]
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .####[['no disc', 'negative']]
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .####[['software', 'positive']]
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .####[['macro shots', 'positive']]
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .####[['headphones', 'negative']]
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .####[['software', 'negative']]
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .####[['tech support', 'negative']]
the lcd screen was very large and readable .####[['lcd screen', 'positive']]
the grain was terrible .####[['grain', 'negative']]
yes , the features are numerous .####[['features', 'positive']]
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .####[['mp3 player', 'positive']]
it also lets you remove songs from the play order .####[['remove songs', 'positive']]
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .####[['price', 'positive']]
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####[['backlight', 'negative']]
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .####[['silent ringer option', 'negative']]
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####[['pc-side software', 'negative']]
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .####[['usb 2.0 transfer', 'positive']]
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .####[['remote', 'negative']]
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .####[['speakerphone', 'positive']]
no way to contact their customer service .####[['customer service', 'negative']]
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .####[['dvds', 'negative']]
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
only one disk played through to completion successfully .####[['disk', 'negative']]
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .####[['speakerphone', 'negative']]
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .####[['editing', 'positive']]
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .####[['picture quality', 'positive']]
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####[['software', 'negative'], ['case', 'negative']]
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .####[['range', 'positive'], ['manual options', 'positive']]
but the earbuds suck !####[['earbuds', 'negative']]
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .####[['use', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####[['volume key', 'negative'], ['press', 'negative']]
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####[['phone', 'positive']]
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .####[['player', 'positive'], ['performs', 'positive'], ['sound', 'negative']]
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes####[['sound', 'positive'], ['interface', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['software', 'positive'], ['wake-up', 'positive'], ['sleep timers', 'positive']]
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .####[['in-program id3 tag editing', 'positive']]
the sound from the player is ok .####[['sound', 'positive']]
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .####[['combination', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .####[['fm radio tuner', 'positive']]
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .####[['optical zoom', 'positive'], ['14x digital zoom', 'positive']]
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .####[['music', 'positive'], ['menus', 'positive'], ['understand', 'positive']]
another plus in my book , no file limits !####[['file limits', 'positive']]
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .####[['earbuds', 'positive']]
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .####[['features', 'positive'], ['speed', 'positive'], ['picture quality', 'positive'], ['flexibility', 'positive'], ['automation', 'positive'], ['functional conveniences', 'positive']]
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .####[['case', 'negative']]
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .####[['product', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['songs', 'positive']]
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .####[['colors', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative']]
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .####[['stock tracking app', 'positive'], ['application', 'negative']]
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .####[['software', 'negative']]
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .####[['software', 'negative']]
this thing plays everything i feed it .####[['plays', 'positive']]
5 . the zen does not have a stop button !####[['stop button', 'negative']]
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !####[['camera', 'positive']]
nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .####[['nokia', 'positive']]
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .####[['player', 'negative']]
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .####[['clock', 'positive'], ['date', 'positive']]
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .####[['accessories', 'negative']]
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['volume', 'positive']]
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .####[['transfer', 'negative']]
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .####[['player', 'negative'], ['recognizing', 'negative'], ['stopping', 'negative'], ['access', 'negative']]
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "####[['frame freezes', 'negative'], ['dvd player', 'negative']]
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .####[['picture', 'positive']]
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .####[['nomad', 'negative']]
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .####[['digital camera', 'positive']]
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .####[['function lever', 'negative']]
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .####[['player', 'positive']]
i have had no problems with the phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .####[['caller-id pictures', 'negative'], ['individualized ringtones', 'negative']]
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .####[['service', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive'], ['ringtones', 'positive'], ['aim', 'positive']]
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .####[['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .####[['mediasource software', 'positive']]
the dvd player just would't recognize them .####[['dvd player', 'negative'], ['recognize', 'negative']]
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !####[['shipping', 'positive']]
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .####[['manual', 'positive'], ['troubleshooting guide', 'positive']]
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all####[['play', 'positive']]
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .####[['remotes', 'negative'], ['worked', 'negative']]
also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['earphones', 'negative']]
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####[['fm', 'negative'], ['voice recording', 'negative']]
the service from t-mobile is very good too .####[['service from t-mobile', 'positive']]
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .####[['price', 'positive'], ['specs', 'positive'], ['memory mp3 player', 'positive']]
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####[['machine', 'positive'], ['set up', 'positive']]
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####[['resolution', 'positive'], ['colors', 'positive']]
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .####[['play', 'negative']]
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .####[['dvd', 'negative'], ['picture', 'negative'], ['freeze', 'negative'], ['plays', 'negative']]
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .####[['read', 'negative'], ['dvds', 'negative']]
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .####[['skipping', 'negative']]
by the way , it looks nice also .####[['looks', 'positive']]
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .####[['no disc', 'negative']]
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
i am enjoying my phone a lot ....####[['phone', 'positive']]
it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .####[['firewire', 'negative']]
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;####[['4mp resolution', 'positive']]
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .####[['g3', 'negative'], ['captures', 'negative']]
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .####[['battery', 'positive']]
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .####[['nomad explorer', 'positive'], ['transfer files', 'positive']]
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .####[['g3', 'positive']]
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !####[['dvd player', 'negative']]
the other controls are all very easy to use .####[['controls', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .####[['4 mp', 'positive'], ['3x optical', 'positive']]
no matter the format .####[['format', 'positive']]
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .####[['accessing files', 'positive']]
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !####[['looks', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .####[['higher pitched rings', 'negative'], ['hear', 'positive'], ['listen', 'negative']]
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .####[['dvd players', 'positive'], ['play', 'positive']]
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !####[['battery life', 'positive']]
and really this is the best phone one could have .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the radio feature has superb sound quality .####[['radio feature', 'positive'], ['sound quality', 'positive']]
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).####[['mediasource', 'positive'], ['looking', 'negative'], ['organizing', 'positive'], ['cddb service', 'positive']]
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####[['case', 'negative']]
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .####[['sounds', 'positive']]
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .####[['runs', 'positive'], ['dvd media', 'positive']]
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery####[['storage capacity', 'positive'], ['navigate', 'positive'], ['playlists', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive']]
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .####[['line out jack', 'negative']]
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .####[['signal to noise ratio', 'positive']]
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####[['quality', 'negative']]
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .####[['tags', 'negative']]
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .####[['camera', 'positive']]
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .####[['voice-activated dialing', 'negative'], ['headset jack', 'negative']]
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .####[['nomad', 'positive'], ['controls', 'positive']]
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !####[['sound volume', 'positive']]
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )####[['diopter adjustment dial', 'negative'], ['turn', 'negative'], ['adjustment', 'negative']]
feels solid in hand .####[['feels', 'positive']]
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####[['lock up', 'negative']]
we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .####[['dvd', 'negative'], ['freeze', 'negative']]
the moveable lcd screen is great .####[['lcd', 'positive']]
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .####[['napster', 'positive']]
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user-friendly player imo .####[['navigation', 'positive']]
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####[['deal', 'positive']]
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .####[['player', 'positive']]
great phone , i 'd buy another .####[['phone', 'positive']]
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .####[['software', 'negative'], ['music match jukebox', 'negative']]
have had the player since xmass and love it !####[['player', 'positive']]
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .####[['mpeg2 format', 'positive'], ['vob files', 'positive']]
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .####[['smell', 'negative']]
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .####[['customer service department', 'negative']]
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .####[['automode', 'positive'], ['aperture priority', 'positive'], ['shutter priority', 'positive']]
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .####[['video signal', 'negative']]
7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .####[['mediasource', 'negative']]
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####[['customization options', 'positive']]
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .####[['backlit screen', 'positive']]
the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !####[['player', 'negative'], ['no disc', 'negative']]
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !####[['powershot g3', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .####[['sync', 'positive']]
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .####[['battery', 'positive']]
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .####[['eax support', 'positive']]
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####[['leather case', 'positive']]
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .####[['canon powershot g3', 'positive']]
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####[['camera', 'positive']]
wo n't play a lot of discs .####[['play', 'negative'], ['discs', 'negative']]
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )####[['plays', 'positive'], ['format', 'positive']]
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .####[['focus range', 'positive'], ['manual focus mode', 'positive']]
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .####[['quality pictures', 'positive'], ['combination', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['flexibility', 'positive']]
1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .####[['size', 'negative'], ['weighs', 'negative']]
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .####[['explorer program', 'negative']]
the software , which comes with player is not good at all .####[['software', 'negative']]
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .####[['dvd', 'negative']]
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .####[['phone', 'positive']]
it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .####[['no disc', 'negative']]
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####[['dvd', 'negative']]
overall an excellent phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the screen 's large and easily read .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive']]
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####[['camera', 'positive']]
software - the software is crap .####[['software', 'negative']]
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .####[['pic', 'positive']]
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .####[['service', 'negative']]
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .####[['auto fit feature', 'positive']]
overall i like the unit .####[['unit', 'positive']]
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .####[['nikon', 'positive']]
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :####[['battery', 'positive']]
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .####[['nokia 6610', 'positive']]
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['presets', 'positive'], ['construction', 'positive']]
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####[['default ringtones', 'negative']]
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .####[['calls', 'negative']]
i can only hear the sound but no picture !####[['picture', 'negative']]
great quality picture and features .####[['quality picture', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .####[['battery', 'positive']]
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .####[['navigation system', 'negative']]
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .####[['earbuds', 'positive']]
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .####[['headphone jack', 'negative']]
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "####[['id3 tags', 'negative']]
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .####[['folder name', 'negative']]
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####[['work', 'negative']]
on my main computer the software did not work right .####[['software', 'negative']]
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .####[['better', 'negative']]
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .####[['player', 'positive']]
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .####[['bluetooth', 'negative']]
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .####[['back-up device', 'positive']]
the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .####[['eax sound enhancement feature', 'negative'], ['custom eq', 'negative']]
overall it is the best camera on the market .####[['camera', 'positive']]
good quality video .####[['quality video', 'positive']]
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####[['optics', 'positive'], ['processing algorithms', 'positive']]
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .####[['scroll', 'positive']]
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .####[['navigation', 'positive'], ['scrolling', 'negative'], ['searching', 'negative']]
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####[['screen saver feature', 'positive']]
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####[['appearance', 'positive']]
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?####[['pc cable', 'negative']]
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).####[['battery life', 'positive']]
interface - practically seamless .####[['interface', 'positive']]
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .####[['case', 'negative']]
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .####[['eax', 'negative']]
this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['warranty', 'negative']]
- solid , high-quality construction####[['construction', 'positive']]
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .####[['3x optical setting', 'positive']]
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####[['looks', 'positive']]
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .####[['wheel', 'negative']]
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .####[['player', 'positive'], ['video output', 'negative']]
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .####[['t-mobile', 'negative']]
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .####[['macro', 'positive']]
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.####[['nomad explorer', 'positive'], ['alter', 'positive'], ['sort', 'positive']]
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :####[['hot shoe flash attachment', 'positive']]
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .####[['apex', 'positive']]
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .####[['player', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['understand features', 'positive'], ['software', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .####[['read', 'negative'], ['dvd disc', 'negative']]
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .####[['price', 'positive'], ['works', 'positive']]
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .####[['discs', 'negative'], ['recognize', 'negative']]
the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .####[['play', 'negative']]
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).####[['volume', 'negative']]
even viewed cds full of jpgs .####[['jpgs', 'positive']]
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .####[['dual-layer dvd', 'negative']]
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .####[['ad-1600', 'negative'], ['ad-1220', 'negative']]
this is the best phone i have seen .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .####[['use', 'positive']]
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .####[['auto mode', 'positive'], ['to', 'positive']]

the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .####[['hold', 'positive']]
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .####[['body', 'negative'], ['construction', 'negative']]
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####[['display', 'positive']]
1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?####[['mediasource software', 'negative'], ['rip', 'positive'], ['catalog', 'positive'], ['burn', 'positive']]
