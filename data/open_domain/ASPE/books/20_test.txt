Author Siddhartha Mukherjee has put together a very comprehensive review of medicine 's history battling cancer .####[['review', 'positive']]
It set a great backdrop for the novel.I was first irritated by how all the major players were linked in two or fewer degrees .####[['novel.I', 'positive']]
If we MUST continue to see the soul-cut-in-half trope recur , can the hero of the next one at least end up getting the extroverted and action-oriented tendencies for once ? I think that 's really it : it 's rare that my opinion of a book is as simple as this , but it really is a simple divide this time.I love the world , I love the supporting characters , I love the idea , and I adore Hobb 's prose.But I simply can not find it in myself to like the protagonist .####[['protagonist', 'positive']]
Thank you Ms. Lackberg for such wonderful writing and especially for having them translated to English..what a loss if they were n't .####[['writing', 'positive'], ['Ms. Lackberg', 'positive']]
As a layman I learned a lot about the history of treating cancer reading this book by Dr. Mukherjee .####[['book', 'positive']]
There is also the issue of whether various treatments were actually extending the lifespans of those afflicted , which was also not as simple as one might think.While the above discussion of science and statistics might make this book seem dreadfully boring , this is n't the case .####[['book', 'neutral']]
After a prologue , the main story starts out with an improbable rescue of a lady-in-distress , and at that point , I questioned whether I would finish the book .####[['book', 'neutral']]
If you 've read books 1 and 2 , you definitely don't want to miss this one !####[['this one', 'positive']]
Ms. Hobbs should write half as much and twice as much action .####[['Ms. Hobbs', 'negative']]
