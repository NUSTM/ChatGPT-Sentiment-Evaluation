The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist.From the Persian Queen Atossa , whose Greek slave may have cut off her diseased breast , to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjees own leukemia patient , Carla , The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to surviveand to increase our understanding of this iconic disease.Riveting , urgent , and surprising , The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments .####[['The Emperor of All Maladies', 'positive']]
These accounts are often gripping , especially as advances accelerate in the mid-1980s , but sets of four or five in a series are enough to cause my attention to drift .####[['accounts', 'positive']]
In addition , cancer may be prevented by encouraging people to avoid environmental carcinogens such as cigarette smoke.This elegant and heartrending narrative is far more than a biography of a terrible malady .####[['narrative', 'negative']]
Long read , but with so much wonderful information !####[['read', 'negative']]
The use of the reality show cast while certainly necessary to the plot was I felt just a bad attempt to stay current with the real world .####[['plot', 'negative']]
Amazing detail .. sometimes difficult to read due to content , not because of the writer ... .####[['content', 'negative']]
This book is a great way to know more about cancer , mainly to understand the complexities surrounding it .####[['book', 'positive']]
Suffice it say that along with George R. R. Martin I will NEVER read another Robin Hobb book .####[['Robin Hobb', 'negative']]
It made the book so personal ; I felt like I was rooting for these people ( I am , each and every one of them ) .This book gives a personality to cancer ... it really is it 's own breathing , living , functioning animal .####[['book', 'positive']]
The characters that the author uses in the full series developed upon previous books but the new characters were a little simple and did n't have much depth .####[['new characters', 'negative']]
Decent maps and great photos , many in color , though I wish another had been chosen for the cover ( got tired of that soldiers stare ) .####[['photos', 'positive'], ['maps', 'positive']]
Sometimes she goes overboard with her expositions of conservative Judaism ( beliefs and practices ) , but thankfully those references are pretty casual in Burnt House.Meanwhile , a clever two-pronged plot centers our attention in this tale .####[['Burnt House.Meanwhile', 'positive'], ['plot', 'positive']]

I sometimes wonder if he realizes how intensely painful it is to read of his service to someone who was obviously cracked in the head .####[['service', 'negative']]
It was too boring , filled with too many unlikeable and pointless characters , and had a complete cop out ending.If you have read the 1st two novels be prepared to be disappointed with this novel .####[['novel', 'negative']]
I hope you were demoted.Shame on the Proofreader who probably did not do their job in the first place .####[['Proofreader', 'negative']]
And it IS sexist , since it is done arbitrarily by sex : men get the last name , women get the first name.Like her husband Jonathan , Kellerman has the annoying habit of describing people 's clothing , even when it is utterly irrelevant , which is most of the time .####[['Kellerman', 'negative']]
Fascinating and quite brilliant book about a complicated subject .####[['book', 'positive'], ['subject', 'negative']]
I was very glad when the latest instalment of the ongoing Midkemia epic came out .####[['latest instalment', 'positive']]

Although I did enjoy ` A Royal Duty ' , I was shocked at Mr. Burrell 's admission that he had lied in that book - but thankfully , he informs us , it was only a ` white lie ' to ` protect ' the Princess .####[['A Royal Duty', 'positive']]
Amazing story about Cancer , is a wonderful path for humanity to beat this beast .####[['story', 'positive']]
The book is not overly technical and is approachable by everyone####[['book', 'positive']]
But , thanks to certain stubbornness and amazing treatment and care , and a generous sift of life from a German donor of life giving stem cells , I am alive.This book helps explain many of the questions I had .####[['book', 'positive']]
Thorough and well researched , this book about cancer is thoughtful and informative .####[['book', 'positive']]
And underlying it all is his sterling medical training and credentials which have been enumerated often elsewhere.The book itself is a tour de force .####[['book', 'positive']]

And , to Mr. Adams ' credit , he doesn't stint on the archeological find , as sometimes happens in these novels .####[['Mr. Adams', 'positive']]

The last 200 pages were phenomenal and often describes why I chose oncology as a profession .####[['last 200 pages', 'positive']]

Carer was very good with this little girl .####[['Carer', 'positive']]

This book is also a tribute to the patients who ultimately die and the doctors , nurses , scientists and families who push to find medicines and research to prolong future cancer patients ' lives and end the stigma of hopelessness that the prognosis of cancer brings .####[['book', 'positive']]
This is a comprehensive history of cancer written in an easily understandable way .####[['history', 'positive']]
The author does a great job keeping track of all the characters without overwhelming the reader .####[['job', 'positive'], ['author', 'positive']]
Shame on you , Faye .####[['Faye', 'negative']]
However , I still found it to be a page-turner , and I think fans of the series will enjoy the book in spite of its faults .####[['book', 'positive']]
The storyline was well written and an excellent ending to the series .####[['storyline', 'positive'], ['ending', 'positive']]
An amazing work .####[['work', 'positive']]
This series had potential and drive .####[['series', 'positive']]
My interest likely comes from having lost parents and a sister to cancer , but it 's a fine and , at times , fascinating read for an understanding of the medical history of dealing with cancer .####[['read', 'positive']]
Good action and insights into human behavior .####[['insights', 'positive'], ['action', 'positive']]
In my opinion she has become a page-turner author and I just couldn't put this book down !####[['author', 'positive'], ['book', 'positive']]
An enjoyable rip-roaring action adventure with the romance of fabulous archaeological treasure to be found in Egypt.The pace of the story proceeds so fast that you really do n't have time to think about the convoluted relationships of the characters .####[['rip-roaring action adventure', 'positive']]
It is virtually impossible to put the book down .####[['book', 'positive']]
More interesting for me in this one , and I have read the whole series , was the relationship between Patrik and Erica and family .####[['relationship between Patrik and Erica and family', 'positive']]
It is easy to work out what is going to happen next except the book ending which came as a surprise , but it leaves the series with a Flash Gordon-esk cliff hanger which ca n't be taken at face value .####[['book ending', 'positive']]
I found it to be more of a novel and a mystery and not so much a crime thriller .####[['crime thriller', 'negative']]
I finished it in a few days , totally fascinated at the human spirit that runs throughout and around the medical and biological jargon - there was truly nothing hard to understand , this author 's gift of explanation and discovery kept me from being able to stop reading .####[['human spirit', 'positive'], ["author 's gift of explanation and discovery", 'positive']]
So Feist 's latest endeavor is a good read - i felt some humanity return to the characters .####[['read', 'positive']]
If you are a fan as I am however you will definitely enjoy the book .####[['book', 'positive']]
truly enjoyed every word - Paul ; was with her for several years and had lots of information - truly enjoyed####[['word', 'positive']]
Any novel that can blend the likes of history with the throes of an edgy thriller is a total winner in my book.I guess my only real problem with The Alexander Cipher was the lack of an appealing main character .####[['main character', 'negative']]
But other than that , their experiences are invaluable for those survivors out there .####[['experiences', 'positive']]
Her accounts are vivid and leave the reader despairing .####[['accounts', 'negative']]
This book helps me understand that .####[['book', 'positive']]
I could n't finish the book it was just too boring and the information presented went in all sorts of directions that was hard to keep straight .####[['book', 'negative']]
I really enjoyed all of the earlier mysteries by Camilla Lackberg and was looking forward to this one .####[['this one', 'positive'], ['earlier mysteries by Camilla Lackberg', 'positive']]
But into the third book , the writing turned so much to repeated introspection that I started browsing through paragraphs just to find any action .####[['writing', 'negative']]
Written in an enjoyable style .####[['style', 'positive']]
The plots move forward with logic , and the loose ends come together at the end smoothly .####[['plots', 'positive']]
I did none of those after reading this book .####[['book', 'neutral']]
I watched the movie massacre in wacko txt and I was astonish####[['movie massacre', 'negative']]
However , the unrelenting self-loathing of the main character ( s ) in this book was almost intolerable .####[['main character', 'positive']]
The only flaw I 'm finding now is that I want the text to include an index , since I 've wanted to reference several parts since I 've finished reading , but apparently did n't dog-ear enough pages !####[['index', 'negative']]
Honestly , though , I was blown away by the ending , and made me eager for the final installment.I 've been with Feist throughout the whole journey , starting with Magician as a kid ( and back then , in England , it was released as one HUGE book ) .####[['ending', 'positive']]
I was hoping for more , but what I got was a lot of split personality issues and whiney characterization with the main character of Navare .####[['main character of Navare', 'negative']]
The ending while not a shock , was some what unexpected .####[['ending', 'neutral']]
I liked the story development as I have in the entire Riftwar Cycle of these books .####[['story development', 'positive']]
The history/biography of cancer is very interesting and the early treatments seem either ridiculous or brutal , as well as nearly always ineffective , as seen through modern hindsight .####[['history/biography of cancer', 'positive']]
If anyone else were to do a history of cancer , they truly could not match the quality of this book .####[['book', 'positive']]
Still the book has popular appeal because it is a history and the subject concerns what any healthy adult has in the back of his mind .####[['book', 'positive']]
The insiders like the sisters here write about the illusions to the public and to outsiders such as relatives who visit their loved ones.This book is a triumph against the Children of God for revealing shocking accounts of blatant abuse of children and even it 's adult members .####[['accounts of blatant abuse of children', 'negative'], ['book', 'positive']]
Her writing style is very easy to read and I 'm always pulled into it .####[['writing style', 'positive']]
I found myself skipping pages at a time just to get to some plot development .####[['plot', 'negative']]
Melberg is the true star of the subplots here , and I love what they did with his character in this novel.I might just keep reading on , especially now that in the next episode , there promises to be more of the Erika and Patrik interaction that I loved about the first book.Note : this book also appears with the title The Gallows Bird , which is a terrible title .####[['Erika and Patrik interaction', 'positive'], ['title', 'negative'], ['novel.I', 'positive']]
I loved the development of the characters was great !####[['development of the characters', 'positive']]
Although this brave reporter must have drawn heavily from her articles and notes , the book is more than a collection dusted off for publication .####[['reporter', 'positive'], ['book', 'positive']]
This story was very well written , and tragic all at the same time .####[['story', 'positive']]
Superbly written , both with meticulous detail of the science and practice of oncology , as well as case histories to bring home the impact of this terrible malady.Also , be sure to see the excellent documentary with the same name on Public TV , or via the web .####[['documentary', 'positive']]
It has helped me do a great deal of brainstorming about the fundamentals of my business , including challenging my own biases and preconceptions about my shop.The only reason my review is not 5 stars is that it does repeat itself a bit at the end .####[['end', 'positive']]
I thought renegade 's magic was a bit on the boring side .####[["renegade 's magic", 'negative']]
Amazon does refund the return .####[['Amazon', 'positive']]
Was n't all that taken by the book while I read it , it was slow and the relationship parts were too goody-goody for me .####[['relationship parts', 'positive']]
This book fills that gap beautifully , providing a timeline of the major discoveries , treatments past and present , and a glimpse at where the field could and should go .####[['book', 'positive']]
I have read and enjoyed many Swedish police thrillers of which The Stranger is one .####[['The Stranger', 'positive']]
( A little shocked by some of the errors in editing ) - but that did not spoil my overall enjoyment of the story itself .####[['errors in editing', 'negative'], ['story', 'positive']]

Nevare is basically the same guy in a different outfit.In the first book of the Soldier Son series I was excited about the world Hobb was creating , and I always love the creative lengths she goes to describe the landscapes that her characters travel through ( she 's especially good at describing forests ! ) .####[['Hobb', 'positive'], ['world', 'positive']]
The sisters have done a brave job in detailing painful memories and experiences of their lives .####[['job', 'positive']]
Great read , a bit technical , but worth the effort .####[['read', 'positive']]

There must have been another way to write their part ; but , I digressAnd finally , some characters are a true testament to narcissism , obnoxiously or sadly so .####[['characters', 'negative']]
I feel Robin Hobb is just about the best person writing complex epic fantasy these days , and her stories are chock full of original ideas or if not wholly original , used in new and different ways.This series is certainly that way .####[['Robin Hobb', 'positive']]
In this case , Ms. Kellerman did an excellent job of keeping the resolution hidden until very near the end.From reading this book , I hope that Ms. Kellerman will write more books that contain difficult puzzles whose solutions only gradually reveal themselves through police investigations.Bravo , Ms. Kellerman !####[['Ms. Kellerman', 'positive']]
Lackberg is an excellent writer ; her books do not recycle the same plot .####[['Lackberg', 'positive']]
The following review is largely a quick comparison between the Assassin books and Soldier Son.Yes , Nevare is a different character from Fitz , but he is very well drawn out and consistent throughout .####[['Nevare', 'positive']]
My kids loved the small books , they could take them along in the car when we travelled , etc .####[['small books', 'positive']]
A great read for armchair travelers , history buffs , and adventure buffs .####[['read', 'positive']]
This , by far , is the least-inspiring series of the bunch.For those who have read the Farseer trilogies , Nevare will come off as a flimsy carbon copy of Fitz : a conflicted , sometimes thick-headed , often goofy , but always heroic protagonist .####[['Nevare', 'negative']]
As usual another fantastic book by Raymond .####[['book', 'positive']]

These true stories sometimes show the roller coaster ride that we associate with fictionsuch as the apparent cure of a form of childhood leukemia that seemed promising until the kids once in remission started coming back with symptoms ( the leukemia crossed the brain-blood barrier and found fertile ground on the other side of a biological wall that was meant to keep such neer-do-wells out .####[['stories', 'positive']]

I am patiently waiting for the last of the Rain Wild Chronicles and I know I will be sad to finish the book and will have to read all her books again .####[['book', 'positive']]
I recommend the series not because you will smile while reading it , but because -- if you are are a fan of human complexity -- reading it will annoy you like a deep muscle massage given by Angry Helga , and then leave you feeling kind of floaty and satisfied afterwards.At this point , I will read anything by Hobb , no matter what .####[['series', 'positive']]
It 's kind of odd to see a fantasy of quite this tree-hugging nature , but it works.The ending may strike some as odd or too convenient , but I found myself smiling at its quirkiness ( as well as being satisfied ) .The book is a good , strong read , if not Hobb 's best .####[['read', 'positive']]

And even though one might expect Feist to be going through the motions at this point , the world has become so richly imagined that he is able to keep both his own and his readers ' enthusiasm going after 30 years.So if you have liked any of Feist 's previous books , you 'll enjoy A Crown Imperiled - and if you 're a fan of high fantasy ( that is , a pre-industrial world with magic and other races aside from human ) , then go back and start with Magician , as Feist has carefully crafted a long-running series that has evolved into one of the best of its kind.Of course , some books are better than others , and in this one , Feist can't resist bringing back some characters he already killed off -- but at least he doesn't go the lengths Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson did in their sorry finish to the Dune series .####[['series', 'positive'], ['A Crown Imperiled', 'positive'], ['world', 'positive'], ['Feist', 'positive']]

There were too many characters populating the storyline .. and too many plots as well -- from the past-and-present murder investigations spread over several towns -- to the intrigue of the reality show being filmed -- to the italicized flashbacks of a unknown narrator.The book had an interesting ending -- which I didn't see coming .####[['ending', 'positive'], ['plots', 'negative'], ['characters', 'negative']]

I find myself not even able to think of anything clever to title this review ( assuming I am ever clever in the first place ) .I had high hopes for this novel as it dealt with the long-hidden tomb of Alexander The Great , and the discovery that there may be a treasure trove of ancient artifacts buried with him up for grabs.Daniel Knox , the protagonist of the book , is your average , run of the mill 'hero ' for a novel of this ilk ... .he of course gets swept up in a quest to find the purported treasure , and of course the requisite bad guys and damsel in distress that he 'seemingly ca n't resist ' make appearances throughout the book.What does n't make an appearance , to me , is a plot that shows anything more than the most basic of research into the life and death of one of the greatest warriors in history ... a man who changed the face of Greece and Macedonia in his efforts to conquer the world.For a book to just kill time with , this will certainly do the trick .####[['book', 'neutral']]

Sometimes it seemed that Feist was laboring to convey his story -- not sure if this is simply the complexity of a world grown over nearly 30 books , or Feist powering through and not taking time in his rewrites , but parts were uncharacteristically clunky .####[['parts', 'negative']]
Please note , I give this book 5 stars .####[['book', 'positive']]
The plot is quite good , though as other reviewers have pointed out , the intermingling of the character relationships is just too easy and convenient .####[['plot', 'positive']]

As a cancer survivor , I highly recommend this book to anyone touched by the disease .####[['book', 'positive']]
Bearing their own emotional scars , they now devote their lives to sharing their story with others , and helping all the child victims of cults around the world.The story told by the three sisters in this book is eye-opening and brutally honest , yet at no point overly sentimental or self-pitying .####[['story', 'positive']]

It is , however , testament to some excellent planning that Hobb executes the climax in the way she does ; she 's obviously been writing toward this moment since the very first words of this trilogy , and she weaves a number of disparate and seemingly meaningless clues into her solution to this whole mess .####[['planning', 'positive']]

I 'm also curious if they 'll ever release all the books as a box set , or maybe as a digital set on the Kindle ... ? The only part which didn't make much sense to me ( and seemed like a huge waste of time , or perhaps a page filler ) was the journey of Hal , Ty , Stephane and Gabriella.Anyway , if you 're a fan of Feist , get this book as I doubt you 'll be disappointed - the paperback version that I got seems to be free of the errors that plagued the hardcover .####[['book', 'negative']]

In a sense both Siddhartha Mukherjee and Ken Burns has given a voice to this darkness that slowly is causing thousands to die , suffer , or go through.Not only does this book and documentary explore the vast history of this horror , but it also puts a face on this monster .####[['Siddhartha Mukherjee', 'positive']]
Dr. Mukherjee may be a cancer physician , but I really hope he continues to write , as his prose is such a beautiful thing , and his ability to explain scientific concepts in such a way as to make them totally accessible to the lay public .####[['Dr. Mukherjee', 'positive'], ['prose', 'positive']]

Meticulously crafted and organized , the book traces the history of cancer as it would a personal history ( hence calling it a biography of cancer ) , dispelling myths such as cancer being a modern disease .####[['book', 'positive']]

The cost to the Afghan civilian population has been even more frightening.I can not recommend this book highly enough to any reader looking for a work that ties together so many of the loose ends in Afghanistan .####[['book', 'positive']]
This is a genre I absolutely love - combining historical fact with fiction .####[['genre', 'positive']]
The violence is over the top sometimes but overall these books are great escapism with likeable characters .####[['characters', 'positive'], ['books', 'positive']]
I learned so much from this sad story of Jody .####[['story', 'negative']]
While the book ends on a hopeful note about more targeted treatment , cancer has not gone gently into that good night.While the book covers a broad period , the bulk of its pages are devoted to the latter half of the 20th century .####[['book', 'positive'], ['its pages', 'negative']]
And throughout the book , in a brief reflective passage at the beginning of each chapter , we enter the mind of a man who will clearly emerge with a key role in the story.If your taste runs to intellectually challenging fare in detective fiction , youll love the Fjllbacka series .####[['Fjllbacka series', 'positive']]

I was so excited at the beginning of the book and thoroughly enjoyed the early history on cancer , especially how cancer was treated in the 19th century and prior .####[['early history on cancer', 'positive'], ['beginning', 'positive']]

Having so aptly dispensed with past and present , it left me wanting for more about the future.These notes aside , if you 've even a tangential interest in cancer or biology , Mukherjee 's opus remains a must-read .####[["Mukherjee 's opus", 'positive']]
I lost both parents to cancer , and my mother 's uncle , Dr Peter Mozden , was an oncologist who started the first hospital department of oncology in Boston in the 1950s , so I was deeply interested in reading this book but feared it might be dry and technical in its approach .####[['book', 'negative']]
Parts of the story are unclear .####[['Parts of the story', 'negative']]
I love reading them though !####[['them', 'positive']]
I wasn't that enthralled with this book , so doubt I will read any further entries from this author .####[['book', 'neutral']]

And it was good to find out how Peter 's colleague Marge and her adopted daughter , Vega ( rescued from a cult in a previous book ) , are doing.This book is a page-turner and a very enjoyable read .####[['book', 'positive']]
But I love the characters .####[['characters', 'positive']]
If you 're going to publish a book this thick and arcane to most readers , you better write well and have lots to say .####[['book', 'neutral']]

wow ... not a happy book ... but well written , clear , honest and grateful to have read it .####[['book', 'positive']]
The retrospective of cancer discovery is so vast and detailed that these rare moments where the story reverts to the present can feel like an oasis.Roughly half of The Emperor is comprised of five and ten-page vignettes where Mukherjee poses a question ( If XY , then could XYZ ...####[['retrospective of cancer discovery', 'positive']]
This is a wonderful story about a devoted caregiver and a troubled child .####[['story', 'positive']]
Hope springs eternal as each new discovery emboldens and humbles our best efforts to understand the emperor of all maladies.A good many writers have a commanding grasp of their subject , but a scant few bring such a wide swath of education , understanding of literature , and the human condition as Siddhartha Mukherjee .####[['Siddhartha Mukherjee', 'positive']]

Jonathan Kellerman 's Compulsion was another dud , and Faye Kellerman 's The Burnt House is another good work.The title residence is actually an apartment building in which a commuter plan has crashed into shortly after its takeoff from Burbank heading towards San Jose .####[['The Burnt House', 'positive']]

Brave to that fact of making it known the disgusting things these so-called 'adults ' put them through & then these 'adults ' trying to justify their crimes through the word of the lord.I can only wish Kristina , Celeste & Juliana well , & congratulate them on their brave fight & wish them well in their continued fight to expose organisations such as the 'Children of God'.This is a very good , well written , but painful book .####[['book', 'negative'], ['things', 'negative']]

It is also a story of paternalism , arrogance , and false hope , as well as inventiveness , determination , and inspiration .####[['story', 'negative']]
Another great story with a twist .####[['story', 'positive']]
