Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a history geek and I appreciate that the author has clearly done his research ( having visited both Alexandria and Cairo , I found his descriptions of the cities and sights to be spot on ) , and knowing much Greek , Macedonian and Egyptian history , I appreciate that , but I , the reader , do n't need to know it all to understand the book .####[['book', 'positive'], ['author', 'positive']]

Although I 'm a big fan of Camilla Lackberg , Gallows Bird was n't up to the standard of the earlier 3 books which were all much better written , far better plots / better story lines , this could n't compare to her other books , plus it was so confusing and overly wordy and it did n't make that much sense .####[['Camilla Lackberg', 'positive'], ['Gallows Bird', 'negative'], ['books', 'positive'], ['plots', 'positive'], ['story lines', 'positive']]

I read Burrell 's other book , A Royal Duty and came away feeling that the author was obsessed with his employer and that he was a neurotic.Addtionally , I was inclined to think his character was somewhat questionable due to the surrounding Scotland Yard case against him ( although he was acquitted ) as well comments made by others during interviews I 've seen and other things I 've read.However , I really thought this book , The Way We Were was a nice tribute to Diana , Princes of Wales , and I think Burrell did a nice job in tyring to dispel the myths , gossip , and rumors that have surrounded this much written about subject.I particulary enjoyed reading his recollections about Diana 's relationship with Hasnat Khan and his two sons ' recollections of their childhood friendship with Princes William and Harry .####[['Way', 'positive'], ['job', 'positive']]

There 's many ways to end a story , but whatever ` chapter ` or I suspect chapters are defective , it reads like the TV show 24 set on the Star War 's Planet Alderaan and then unbeknownst , the Death Star shows up after 400 pages and so much for 400 pages of Alderaan '24 ' intrigue ... everyone dies ( although Midkemia has been exhibiting some narrative changing resurrections in this 2-book installment ) .The hardback is not inexpensive .####[['hardback', 'neutral']]

A fairly good plot , some very good historical information , but with very cookie cutter characters - the hero who gets in and out of trouble repeatedly , the villains who are after the hero but continue to miss their opportunity to put an end to him , the sidekick who helps the hero out of several jams , and in this case unlike some others in this space , a rather weak female lead.Descriptions of the sites are done very well and at a good level of detail , putting you right there with the characters .####[['lead.Descriptions', 'positive'], ['characters', 'negative'], ['historical information', 'positive'], ['plot', 'positive']]

There were surprising similarities to the Farseer trilogy , which I will not go into ( as they are spoilers ) , but they relate to how he gets out of a few impossible situations.I felt the end was rushed -- some resolutions happen offpage -- but others who read it felt the end was fine.Robin Hobb is one of the best fantasy writers out there .####[['fine.Robin Hobb', 'positive'], ['end', 'negative']]

And it 's a very hard book to put down.As other reviewers have said , this is probably not the best place to start the series , as a fair amount of background knowledge is assumed .####[['book', 'positive']]
He even surpasses Superman.Almost all the adventures of different characters are often unbelievable , but none so much as SuperKnox , who escapes innumerable attempts on his life.The ending is somewhat amusing to see finally how he escapes serving a decade in an Egyptian prison.I ca n't deem the novel as all bad , but be prepared to page through a lot of unintelligible trivia .####[['novel', 'neutral']]
By the time I had finished the series I was hooked as a Robin Hobb fan and find myself buying all of her works I can find .####[['Robin Hobb', 'positive']]

If you are new to Feist , I 'd recommend at least going back to the start of the Chaoswar trilogy ... .preferably back to the first in the series , Magician.I highly recommend this book .####[['book', 'positive']]
I love the characters and the surprises .####[['surprises', 'positive'], ['characters', 'positive']]
Love the history and descriptions of how the search to heal or prevent cancer has transpired over the years .####[['history', 'positive'], ['descriptions', 'positive']]
I really like it.Be forewarned ( as other reviews have noted ) , this book sets up Magician 's End and you will not be particularly satisfied with the ending without keeping this in mind .####[['ending', 'neutral'], ['it.Be', 'positive']]
However , I wish Erica would have had a more substantial part in the main story of the book .####[['Erica', 'positive']]

I have had this on my shelf for several years for intended reading : Had I appreciated what a compelling narrative Mukherjee sets out , and how well he tells it , I would have read it much sooner.As there are numerous , good reviews of this exceptional book , I will not pile on , except to say that this is a comprehensive and detailed treatment for the non-expert , that manages to explain the science ( and some of the politics ) with clarity , while providing a compelling and often moving narrative .####[['narrative', 'positive'], ['book', 'positive']]
Awesome book .####[['book', 'positive']]

Why does Faye Kellerman continue to succeed while her husband slides downhill ?####[['Faye Kellerman', 'positive']]
I 'm not sure how anyone who has read Robin Hobb 's prior books , not just this trilogy but the three others she 's written , can read this book and say it disapoints and isn't as good as the others.I mean OK folks can certainly have their opinion but to me this books is just as good as the other books in the Soldiars Son trilogy and on equal footing with her other trilogy finale books.What I truly enjoy about her characters is that they become so real for me , they aren't 100 % good or bad and they are always ruled by events and the stuff that life throws at them and are ultimately just as fallible as we real world humans are .####[['characters', 'positive'], ['books', 'positive']]
This book is well written and highly recommended .####[['book', 'positive']]
I had to read a few pages twice to make sense of some statements , sometimes unsuccessfully.The biggest goof is that the author changed his mind about which character should be in a situation but forgot to make it consistent .####[['statements', 'negative']]

Not that there is no humour the author has the ability to bring an ironic touch to the darkest scenes but this is not a crime novel for the faint hearted .####[['crime novel', 'negative']]
I will read it instead.The author should stick to writing his books , and not reading them aloud .####[['author', 'negative']]
The eventual move to move his body back to Macedonia , and the press conference and corruption of the Egyptian antiquities people just made everything too convenient to end the story.It definitely stopped looking like anything from an Indiana Jones adventure probably after they lifted the plinth and then mutated into something beyond comprehension .####[['story.It', 'negative']]
There are major differences in the characters and I liked the TV series more in this respect although the story lines were good in both formats .####[['story lines', 'positive']]
