I love these , this time they ran a little large####[['they', 'negative']]
They are also super warm !####[['They', 'positive']]
I wear them in place of stockings with business clothes and they look good , feel good .####[['they', 'positive']]
I have n't yet danced in them , but they seem much more durable than my other pair of tights .####[['they', 'positive']]
Nice quality , attractive , light weight , and just what I wanted , BUT .####[['quality', 'positive']]
They make your legs look great !####[['They', 'positive']]
I like this blouse better in person .####[['blouse', 'positive']]
It 's become his new favorite sweatshirt .####[['sweatshirt', 'positive']]
The supposedly narrow width , however , was so wide my foot would not stay in the shoe .####[['shoe', 'negative']]
I could not get the Capezio on because they were way too tight .####[['Capezio', 'negative']]
I purchased these sandals a few months ago - They fit good , comfy and just want I needed .####[['They', 'positive']]
Im so glad I found them .####[['them', 'positive']]
I ended up ordering another pair in a size 8 and they fit great .####[['they', 'positive']]
No matter what I am wearing , I seem to always go back to one of these Mimosas .####[['Mimosas', 'positive']]

Good quality shoe .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
These are nice and thick and silky so they last a long time and feel nice .####[['they', 'positive']]
I like these and the price was half of what I normally have to pay for narrow shoes .####[['price', 'positive']]
They were very comfortable right from the start .####[['They', 'positive']]
I was just looking for a nice pair of black shoes that were n't sneakers , and the price on these made them very eye-catching ( especially when I went to look at them again and they 'd dropped from $ 35 to $ 25 ) .####[['price', 'positive'], ['them', 'positive']]
They were not comfortable in the waist either because they were too short and I forced them to fit .####[['they', 'negative'], ['They', 'negative']]
Liked the style , height of heel and look but not the fit .####[['style', 'positive'], ['look', 'positive'], ['height of heel', 'positive']]
They were a little too large , but the next size smaller would have been too short .####[['They', 'negative']]
I still think they 're nice shoes but a bit fake looking ,####[['shoes', 'negative']]
The best part is they do n't get runners or damage easily .. They are supportive , yet comfortable , even for fuller figured women ! I would suggest them to anyone looking for qualilty tights .####[['They', 'positive'], ['them', 'positive'], ['they', 'positive'], ['tights', 'positive']]
This is just a good , cute shoe that goes to almost any occasion without shame and will keep your feet cool and rested -- unless you go mountain hiking in them , that would make a difference .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
I have much better luck with tights , but needed something that could serve the purpose of pantyhose on my closet .####[['tights', 'positive']]
Great tights ; these were exactly what I was looking for to go along with a costume dress and knee-high boots .####[['tights', 'positive']]
I can not believe the quality of this shirt for under $ 10 .####[['quality', 'positive']]
It 's a bit larger than I expected but I love the color and feel of the fabric .####[['color', 'positive'], ['fabric', 'positive']]
They do n't run , rip or snag if you handle them properly .####[['They', 'positive']]
Even so , a good choice for a reasonably priced character shoe .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
I like the shoe overall .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
The light suntan is almost the perfect shade for me too !####[['light suntan', 'positive']]
I did n't need black and they were a little small .####[['they', 'negative']]
great product and hard to find in stores ... Thank you .####[['product', 'positive']]
My wife is very happy with these sandals .####[['sandals', 'positive']]
fit true to size .####[['size', 'positive']]
I 'm fair and the light toast works well only because I use Lorac Tantalizer on arms , chest and neck otherwise would be darker than my fair skin but will be perfect for summer .####[['Lorac Tantalizer', 'positive'], ['light toast', 'positive']]
They ran pretty quickly####[['They', 'positive']]
They are as comfortable as my old pnes####[['They', 'positive']]
These are nice , comfortable tights .####[['tights', 'positive']]
I bought this same shoe several years ago and loved it ; I was despairing to see it wearing out !####[['shoe', 'positive']]
I believe they only think very tall thin women are dancers ; not short more muscular older athlete .####[['they', 'negative']]
I 've bought many pairs of LifeStride shoes in my life without any problems .####[['shoes', 'positive']]
The shoes came in a timely manner .####[['shoes', 'positive']]
I see the stiches wearing out too soon , if I wear them much .####[['stiches', 'negative']]

But I would recommend them .####[['them', 'positive']]
I like the fleece lining , it helps to keep me warm , definitely a good buy .####[['fleece lining', 'positive'], ['buy', 'positive']]
After taking a look at the size chart on the packaging , I didn't even bother to try these on and instead returned them immediately .####[['them', 'negative']]
The bottom of the shoes are slippery but walking on regular roads or floor should give you enough traction , I do remember the initial concern when I first put them on .####[['them', 'negative'], ['bottom', 'negative']]
Awesome for wearing for those more revealing cosplays ... At first I was scared when I got it because it was a lot darker than my actual skin tone but when I put it on it stretched out and matched it a lot better ... No one knew I was wearing tights !####[['tights', 'negative']]
They 're dressy enough to wear with skirts , but casual for slacks and shorts .####[['They', 'positive']]
The fit is comfortable and snug but not too tight and no pain when wearing them , painless , stylish , arrived on time , and these can be worn for dance , casual , or formal , anything really , not too thick and bulky , not to thin and flimsy , perfect fit , they 're good shoes , I would recommend .####[['them', 'positive'], ['shoes', 'positive']]
Great fit , great look !####[['look', 'positive']]
Sent the wrong color and too much of a hassle to send back , but these sandals are great !####[['sandals', 'positive']]

The only reason I returned it was because the elastic at the heel strap of one of the shoes was stretched out and the shoe flapped on my foot .####[['elastic at the heel strap of one of the shoes', 'negative']]
These are very comfortable and durable tights .####[['tights', 'positive']]
I bought these to wear with my yoga leotard and they fit fine .####[['they', 'positive']]

There is a manufactured hold on the bottom of the foot that is wonderful .####[['manufactured hold', 'positive']]
I love the look and the construction of the shoe ; however , it ran a little too small .####[['look', 'positive'], ['construction', 'positive'], ['shoe', 'negative']]
The boots look nice ( a little artificial though . )####[['boots', 'positive']]

Unfortunately , the waistband in the XXL was still much too tight .####[['waistband', 'negative']]
Get a size larger than normal .####[['size', 'negative']]
Shoes are too small even though I order one size bigger , its still too small####[['Shoes', 'negative']]
The sandals are what I expected .####[['sandals', 'positive']]
These are constructed so that the front is wrapped without stitching where it tends to rub .####[['front', 'positive']]
They are extremely comfortable and look very nice .####[['They', 'positive']]
Over the years , I have owned almost every color of this shoe .####[['shoe', 'positive']]

These tights are durable , suck you in and comfortable .####[['tights', 'positive']]
Beautiful shoe####[['shoe', 'positive']]

I wish I stated wearing them instead of regular pantyhose .####[['them', 'positive']]
Otherwise are ok tights .####[['tights', 'neutral']]
Heavy shimmery stockings that are nice for winter .####[['stockings', 'positive']]
Even if you had calves like Schwarzenegger they would be too big .####[['they', 'negative']]
I bought them mainly because I have nerve damage , as well as severe arthritis in my legs , and I have talked to countless Hooters girls who have all sworn by them because the ones that have gotten in the past are simply too expensive , but these danskins are of the same quality , and hold up , and keep the gloss alive for a long time as well as the one other important reason to wear them is support which is my reason for wearing them .####[['the ones', 'negative'], ['danskins', 'positive']]
Excellent shipping and quality .####[['shipping', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
They are super soft and stretchy , and I prefer my tights a little tighter , especially because they stretch .####[['They', 'positive'], ['tights', 'positive']]
They 're well made tights that I wear with my uniform as a gallery guard at Mia .####[['tights', 'positive']]
These tights have a gorgeous , shimmery , sheen to them , which is exactly what I was looking for .####[['sheen', 'positive'], ['them', 'positive']]
It 's an attractive sandal .####[['sandal', 'positive']]
I was hoping since Capezio made those they would have changed the waistband on these , but they did n't ( minus the 1 star ) .####[['they', 'negative']]
So basically the chart is way off , order your regular size or a size down .####[['chart', 'negative']]
The transition hole is also just right to fit ones foot through .####[['transition hole', 'positive']]
Quality was good , price was good , next time I will order larger and way earlier so I can avoid being gouged by the dance shop .####[['Quality', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
I was told on the site the shoe ran small , so I ordered a 1/2 size larger ( I normally wear a 9 but got a 9 1/2 .####[['shoe', 'negative']]
I do n't really like the tight waistband .####[['waistband', 'negative']]
nice shirt but way to small .####[['shirt', 'positive']]
Very soft too ... . Color does not matter for me ... . Great price also ... .####[['Color', 'negative'], ['price', 'positive']]
So in that sense they are on the smaller side when compared to regular street clothing .####[['they', 'negative']]
Light weight sweatshirt .####[['sweatshirt', 'positive']]
Then I wore them to work with a pink sweater and longer tutu skirt -- looked awesome with that too .####[['them', 'positive']]
Seems as if Lifestride just reinvented the colors with new names.Since I returned them , I was disappointed that the seller did not provide a pre-paid return label .####[['seller', 'negative']]
Overall , I like the boots , but I am concerned that the printed design will scratch too easily .####[['boots', 'positive']]

First impressions , I am pleased with them , but time will tell how they hold up .####[['them', 'positive']]
My second pair of this sandal .####[['sandal', 'positive']]

I was happy to find them on Amazon and ordered a few more pairs .####[['them', 'positive']]
They were great .####[['They', 'positive']]
A great price and very good quality . extremely soft .####[['price', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
The black shoes have a soft bed from a fabric that feels almost like fleece and my feet sweat quickly in it.BALANCE : One issue that I have with all four pairs of Capezio shoes that I ordered ( will return 3 ) is that the heel seems to be at a slightly different angle than the front part of the shoe .####[['bed', 'positive'], ['heel', 'negative'], ['all four pairs of Capezio shoes', 'negative'], ['fabric', 'negative']]
They easily stretched wide enough , but not long enough .####[['They', 'positive']]
So , four stars for fashion , zero for product quality .####[['fashion', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]

However , I had to re-attach all the buttons after wearing it once , and it really has to be dry-cleaned or the sleazy fabric becomes stiff as a board .####[['fabric', 'negative'], ['buttons', 'negative']]
Great fit , true to size !####[['size', 'positive']]

I bought classic light toast , I 'll be ordering a second pair in just light toast to better fit my skin tone ( super pale ) and they run a little small in the hips , so getting a size up in my opinion is a good idea .####[['they', 'negative']]
My issue is that I caught a glimpse of myself with them on in a clothing store and I realized that they 're a little too comfortable looking .####[['they', 'negative']]
I wish they would make the waistband slightly wider to create a smoother line , but it does work very well as is .####[['waistband', 'positive']]
I have Mimosa 's in three colors , camel , dark blue and red .####[["Mimosa 's", 'neutral']]
So even if they had fit , I 'm not sure I would have kept them .####[['them', 'negative']]

The only caveat is that the sole is not as wide as the 4E width of the shoe so I can feel the edges of the sole under my feet when I 'm walking .####[['sole', 'negative']]
The dog chewed up my first pair and this is a perfect match and I 'm happy with them .####[['them', 'positive'], ['match', 'positive']]

The ribbing on the sides of the shirt looks nice in person and adds a somewhat more unique flair to a basic closet staple .####[['ribbing', 'positive']]
I loved them.I wear the sandals about twice a week and today the strap broke .####[['them.I', 'positive'], ['strap', 'negative']]
I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts .####[['them', 'positive']]
I think the sizes run true , and not small , as others posted in reviews I read .####[['sizes', 'positive']]
I really enjoy my shoes , use them for Salsa and West Coast/East Coast swing .####[['shoes', 'positive']]

For some reason , these were strange fitting.The instructions to return are so confusing I have hesitate returning them , but I do n't want to pay for a pairof shoes I ca n't & wo n't wear .####[['shoes', 'negative'], ['instructions to return', 'negative']]
We still have competition tights from 3 years ago , that no longer fit my daughter and they are still in good shape - some minor snags .####[['competition tights', 'negative'], ['they', 'positive']]
The whole idea here is that the sweaters are warm and cheap , I even gave recognition of that in my first review .####[['sweaters', 'positive']]
But I do recommend these tights .####[['tights', 'positive']]
They really look pretty on my feet .####[['They', 'positive']]
The XL is the perfect oversized sweatshirt for me and I 'm able to layer under if needed .####[['sweatshirt', 'positive']]

Think about trying a size bigger .. Great Capezio Quality in material and construction .####[['Capezio Quality', 'positive'], ['construction', 'positive'], ['material', 'positive']]
After a few hour 's of wear they fit great .####[['they', 'positive']]
too bad they were so tight in my normal size and had to send back .####[['they', 'negative']]

Love the boot but hard inside hurts foot..Just add a cushion inside####[['inside', 'negative'], ['boot', 'positive']]
I ordered another after receiving the first .####[['the first', 'positive']]
The color is terrible .####[['color', 'negative']]
I 'm 5 ' 8 and bought a S/M.I thought it wouldn't fit over my thighs but it did and went all the way up the the waist.It was a bit snug around the waist but that can be solved with a bit of a diet .####[['waist.It', 'negative'], ['thighs', 'positive']]
Not only were they too tight but they were too long length wise - I checked the sizing chart before I ordered them and I ordered my normal size .####[['they', 'negative']]
However , they run short .####[['they', 'negative']]
I ordered a S/M when I should have ordered a M/L , but they fit quite well save the waist elastic ( which I will be adjusting ) .####[['they', 'positive']]
they re beautiful though - and good quality .####[['they', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
The elastic on the heel strap is sewn in right at the back of the heel with rather bumpy seams , so if the strap is a bit loose , it rubs against the ankle uncomfortably .####[['elastic', 'negative']]
These boots must be good .####[['boots', 'positive']]
They even survived spattered oil stains from a Thanksgiving kitchen mishap - washed right out .####[['They', 'positive']]
Absolutely love the color of this hoodie !####[['color', 'positive']]

I have this shoe in another color but this time I ordered a larger width and that did n't work but this is a nice shoe and very comfortable after it 's broken in .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
I wish they made these in the full body tight , they are the perfect color for my skin , capezio is the best quality , I have gotten body wrappers also ( which the color is a tad closer to mine ) and although they are great quality too they have seemed to run or snag a bit more than the capezio tights ( they last a long time though and I use them for aerial silks/trapeze/hoop so they get a lot of friction ) .####[['they', 'positive'], ['color', 'positive'], ['capezio', 'positive'], ['capezio tights', 'positive']]
The sleeves of the sweater are a little baggy , but nothing to hate .####[['The sleeves of the sweater', 'negative']]

The transition foot is great because she can take the tights up and over her foot to her ankle so she can wear regular shoes or sandals to dance class , then she can just pull the foot down over her toe to put her ballet slippers on .####[['transition foot', 'positive']]
Bought a Hanes large , not nearly as generous , or as long , as this is .####[['Hanes', 'positive']]
One thing that is strange is that while the shoe is narrow and fit me , the band for the ankle was too wide .####[['band for the ankle', 'negative']]
They fit perfectly , I wear them often .####[['They', 'positive']]
Great price , nice fit####[['price', 'positive'], ['fit', 'positive']]

They require that you return the shoes using trackable shipping which costs a small fortune .####[['shoes', 'negative']]
It was really difficult to find and I was a little hesitant to buy something online without being able to see it against my skin , but the price for this was good and I had not many other choices .####[['price', 'positive']]

The Camel color while looks a little like something my grandmother might wear , it works very well with neutral colors without having to get white sandals .####[['color', 'negative']]
The shoes did fit well however I took everyone 's advice and ordered a half size larger .####[['shoes', 'positive']]
The transition opening is big enough to easily switch them to capri-style without too large of an opening for wearing with ballet shoes .####[['transition opening', 'positive']]
they will be excellent for dance practice .####[['they', 'positive']]

I love the way this sandal looks and fits .####[['sandal', 'positive']]
They also are opaque enough to hide almost any flaws in your legs , such as bruises , cellulite , or hair , if you need to shave or wax : ) At first I wasn't sure why these were called Ultra Shimmery tights , but then I took a flash photo of them , and they really did look ultra shimmery !####[['They', 'positive'], ['they', 'positive']]
It 's still my favorite summer shoe : comfortable , feminine , and goes with everything -- - not overly dressy and not overly casual .####[['shoe', 'positive']]

They worked but can definitely stretch for a taller person .####[['They', 'neutral']]
This is a great shoe .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
If I went with the next size up the shoe would have been too long .####[['shoe', 'negative']]
They are just what I was looking for and had not been able to find in any stores .####[['They', 'positive']]
The only real drawback is ( like all other dance shoes ) , they do run significantly small .####[['they', 'negative']]
Length was fine but they gaped a little across the top of my foot and the back strap did n't fit tight .####[['Length', 'positive']]
My 13 year old daughter was delighted with these tights - usually she ca n't wait to get her ballet tights off as soon as her class ends but these were so comfortable I think she forgot she had them on ... .####[['tights', 'positive']]
This shirt will bleed color onto your other clothing items , so do n't let it get wet around white/light colored items.My biggest complaint with this shirt is that the listing , when I purchased it , did not specify that the sleeve length when fully extended was only 3/4th sleeves .####[['sleeve', 'negative']]
They are okay but not comfortable for a lot of walking .####[['They', 'neutral']]
% xl was at best 3xl on the small side..####[['xl', 'positive'], ['3xl', 'negative']]

However , on the product packaging , with height/weight , I am a Large/XLarge !####[['product packaging', 'negative']]
When the right size is purchased they fit fantastic , very comfortable and make it do much easier to dance .####[['they', 'positive']]
I use them to cover my hip pads , the only way to improve these would be to make them more opaque , it takes about 5-6 of these to fully cover the pads .####[['them', 'negative']]
I ballroom dance and wear them with my Latin dress and they make my legs look beautiful .####[['they', 'positive']]
These are n't sparkly , they 're shimmery , which makes my legs look amazing .####[['they', 'positive']]

The moc itself fits fine ( the leather is soft enough to stretch ) but the sole is so narrow it 's way too uncomfortable to wear .####[['moc', 'negative'], ['leather', 'positive'], ['sole', 'negative']]
As long as I won't have any flash photos taken of me , or be under any stage lights , they will not be overwhelming.While these are about three times the cost of most pantyhose you 'd buy at the supermarket , it is certainly a good investment for a sturdy pair of good quality , USA-made tights .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['tights', 'positive']]
Love this shoe .####[['shoe', 'neutral']]
The size said can all but I got a size large or bigger .####[['size', 'negative']]
Plus they are very durable .####[['they', 'positive']]
Wear them to work and casual , even with jeans .####[['them', 'positive']]
These are a great cherry red color and I think would be very comfortable if they fit because they have very soft wide toe straps .####[['toe straps', 'positive']]

The best tights .####[['tights', 'positive']]
The only problem , ( which other people have mentioned ) , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum : I now have three pairs of these shoes , in different colors .####[['they', 'negative'], ['shoe', 'negative']]
I returned them .####[['them', 'negative']]

I 'm happy with this purchase .####[['purchase', 'positive']]
Go down at least one or two sizes.These also are not at all as described - they are not silk touch pique but are a very rough cut material.Even worse , they are almost paper thin.Beware - you will end up paying the full amount to return ship anything defective or wrong description , etc ... to Nayked Apparel.The only beneficiary when you purchase this shirt is Port Authority and either UPS or USPS .####[['they', 'negative'], ['shirt', 'negative'], ['material.Even', 'negative'], ['sizes.These', 'negative']]

I actually purchased the crinoline before the dress and jacket I planned to wear were made.Unfortunately , the dress did not fit as I had hoped but after some rethinking , the dress became a skirt and with the right accessories -- THE CRINOLINE BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE -- I had the 1950 's outfit I wanted.The crinoline really brought back such comforting memories of my childhood , when ladies actually dressed up to go out and the poofier your skirt was the better it looked.I love this crinoline and I 'm trying to think of ways to incorporate it into my daily wardrobe and not just wear it for special occasions .####[['crinoline', 'positive'], ['dress', 'negative']]

The only issue I have with them is the hole in the foot of the tights is too small ( I pull the tights up to my knees for modern and when I 'm on flat in ballet ) , but this is easily remedied by by pulling until they stretch all the way out and putting clear nail polish on any tear that 's made .####[['tights', 'negative']]
