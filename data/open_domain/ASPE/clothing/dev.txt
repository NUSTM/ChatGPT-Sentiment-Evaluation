I ordered the Kelly green & Steel polo shirts both shirts arrived in good condition .####[['condition', 'positive']]
This was a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter ... a men 's medium fit her perfectly ... enough room for a shirt under it ... seem the kids are all wearing these now ... it is a nice quality too ...####[["men 's medium", 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
I very fond of the style but I 'm so sad they were n't for my feet .####[['style', 'positive'], ['they', 'negative']]

The sizing was very true.I am very satisfied with this shoe and highly recommend to anyone needing the wider widths.N.Mayo####[['sizing', 'positive'], ['shoe', 'positive']]
They are comfortable and attractive .####[['They', 'positive']]
Huge sleeves , Baggy sleeves , do n't buy unless you see it first .####[['sleeves', 'negative']]
They are great for my needs ( roller derby ) and would be great for dance .####[['They', 'positive']]
Size is close to right on too .####[['Size', 'positive']]
the last pair is two years old and still has no runs from dancing 6 days a week !####[['pair', 'positive']]
My only complaint -- according to the size chart , I should have fit into a size A ( small ) .####[['size chart', 'negative']]
I will probably wear them until they wear out since they were fairly expensive , but I 'll most likely buy more of the Theatricals XL tights ( which are lower quality but half the price and more comfortable ) when I need new ones .####[['Theatricals XL tights', 'positive'], ['they', 'negative'], ['price', 'positive'], ['quality', 'negative']]
My daughter loves these shoes .####[['shoes', 'positive']]
The tights were on time ... they fit great .####[['they', 'positive'], ['tights', 'positive']]
Quality is very good compared to regular tights , I also got them in black and light toast .####[['Quality', 'positive']]
At 5'11 , I didn't really need any additional height but the little heel does make it easier to stay on my toes and move my feet faster .####[['heel', 'positive']]
I thought she would have to break them in slowly , but she wrote them for a the hour rehearsal and said they were really comfortable .####[['they', 'positive']]
They seem like they will be hardy and still allow for movement and flexibility .####[['they', 'positive']]
I order a whole size larger than my foot , and they are still too small , I just don't understand that .####[['they', 'negative']]
I think they have discontinued them and that 's too bad because they are perfect .####[['they', 'positive']]
I consistently wear the same size no matter what the shoe , so surprised and a little disappointed that the straps on top are a little tight and overall fit is more narrow .####[['straps', 'negative']]
I have similar ones which I bought in the late 1980 's which have never pilled at all .####[['similar ones', 'positive']]
They are comfortable and soft , move with the body , and do n't easily run .####[['They', 'positive']]
This shoe is cute and well made but it is definitely not for wide feet .####[['shoe', 'negative']]
Loved them though - so comfortable !####[['them', 'positive']]
They appear to be well made plus they are comfortable .####[['they', 'positive'], ['They', 'positive']]
I really like the look of these shoes .####[['look', 'positive']]
good product for the price####[['price', 'positive']]
I unfortunately need them for a costume today so I 'm washing and wearing anyway , but I am pretty grossed out that I would be sent hosiery that had clearly been at least tried on by another person .####[['them', 'negative']]
They are not true nude .####[['They', 'negative']]
A very dependable , comfortable shoe !####[['shoe', 'positive']]
im happy with this order it got to me on time and was packaged well they are very good and i love them####[['order', 'positive'], ['they', 'positive'], ['them', 'positive']]
These boots look fantastic but as the saying goes , you get what you pay for .####[['boots', 'positive']]
Very happy with them .####[['them', 'positive']]
I walk about in them all day and my feet are fine , here 's the catch though , I have to break the back straps down .####[['them', 'negative']]
The tights are great quality and not as sheer as regular tights ( so they 're more sturdy ) they 're darker and more opaque which some may not like .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['they', 'negative'], ['tights', 'positive']]
: ( Great quality otherwise !####[['quality', 'positive']]
They are a nice dark navy color .####[['color', 'positive']]
Love this tight .####[['tight', 'positive']]
These are the only dance tights I buy .####[['tights', 'positive']]
Love these and they fit my skinny body perfectly .####[['they', 'positive']]
My main reason for returning these shoes were they were too short/small .####[['shoes', 'negative']]
No support hose####[['hose', 'negative']]
Other than that , they are quite shiny !####[['they', 'positive']]
Perfect for a Daphne Halloween costume .####[['Daphne Halloween costume', 'positive']]
They are holding up well .####[['They', 'positive']]
My toes are a little tight , but it may be the nature of the shoe .####[['shoe', 'neutral']]
I would recommend them to anyone .####[['them', 'positive']]
I thought the than I ordered would be to dark since i 'm very pale but when on they look perfect onstage .####[['they', 'positive']]
I could not find anything like these in my local stores , and although I was afraid to try these , I am extremely glad I did , they are perfect !####[['they', 'positive']]
Unfortunately they were too small .####[['they', 'negative']]
Glad I did , these are definately keepers ! They have not scratched or faded at all , although they are pleathy rather than natural materials - which works out fine for the wet mornings and little spashes because they dry quickly and without discolorization .####[['they', 'negative'], ['They', 'positive']]
They fit great , a little more narrow than I expected being I got the wide and normally do n't have to except in sandals ( no one wants to be squishing out the sides of sandals so I always get the wide widths if available lol ) .####[['They', 'positive']]
Also , the price is actually excellent .####[['price', 'positive']]
Like ths shoe .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
I thought these would be a good go-to option for comfortable black sandals ... and they are .####[['they', 'positive']]
Great looking sandal also .####[['sandal', 'positive']]
If you just want the classic ballet tights then this is not what you want .####[['classic ballet tights', 'negative']]
PS They are pretty and shimmery .####[['They', 'positive']]
Husband had no issues walking in them , just the general have to stretch out the leather .####[['them', 'positive']]
I have tugged and pulled on them with long nails and they have yet to snag or run .####[['they', 'positive']]
Otherwise , the product is fine .####[['product', 'positive']]
Loved the shoes , but sadly had to return them , as they were stamped 9N , but are actually a 9M , too wide for my narrow feet ...####[['them', 'negative'], ['they', 'negative'], ['shoes', 'positive']]
I have n't tried dancing in them but they seem great .####[['they', 'positive']]
I was so excited to see that they came in half sizes - somewhat of a rarity in character shoes .####[['they', 'positive']]
The ivory pair was fine but the pair I ordered that was champaign came with two left shoes .####[['pair', 'positive']]
I love this sandal .####[['sandal', 'positive']]
If you are looking for something more sheer go with Oroblu Repos 70 which I also have and love but more like a strong pantyhose .####[['Oroblu Repos 70', 'positive']]
They fit very well and are very soft without getting runs or getting pilly .####[['They', 'positive']]
They did n't fit right so I returned them .####[['They', 'negative']]
This was a gift and my friend loved them.I have several pairs and love them too .####[['them.I', 'positive'], ['them', 'positive']]

This shoe fits well and is quite comfortable purchased 2 pair and am quite satisfied and will purchase this brand again in the future .####[['shoe', 'positive'], ['brand', 'positive']]
Love these tights .####[['tights', 'positive']]
The light pink shade is very pretty and is a pinkish white color .####[['light pink shade', 'positive']]
They are the only tights my daughter will wear .####[['tights', 'positive']]
The tights are of good quality , but the waistband is very diggy , and cuts you off in the middle .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['waistband', 'negative']]
Other than that great shoes####[['shoes', 'positive']]
Did n't expect the hole in the foot , but these are dance tights ...####[['dance tights', 'negative']]
I wore these for an hour straight dancing and was pleased by them .####[['them', 'positive']]
For the price and brand I expect more .####[['price', 'negative'], ['brand', 'negative']]
I feel like this may actually be a 2 star product but I added an extra because I love the way they looked .####[['they', 'positive']]
Also the strap rubs my heel and makes a blister , so I need a band-aid for that .####[['strap', 'negative']]
Needed a tight that was full coverage , and these are the ones , they fit great , true to size , comfortable , just what I was hoping for####[['they', 'positive']]
I have worn these shoes forever !####[['shoes', 'positive']]
The size is exactly to fit , it 's very thick & cozy !####[['size', 'positive']]
Keeps you warm and cuddly feeling too .####[['feeling', 'positive']]
Very cute flat shoe .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
I put on socks with them so they became better fit .####[['they', 'positive']]

Great fit , great boot , at a great price####[['price', 'positive'], ['boot', 'positive']]
She used to have a pink pair that have worn out and is very disappointed that they are not available in pink .####[['they', 'negative']]
Nice shoe and quality , but did not fit my foot comfortably as was in between sizes .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['shoe', 'positive']]
The thinness of the waistband is a bit uncomfortable as it can lead to more rolls as they say .####[['waistband', 'negative']]
I love them already !####[['them', 'positive']]
I was pleasantly surprised - they are nice - good for concealing bunions .####[['they', 'positive']]
Fabric was thinner than I thought it would be , it 's not see through but if I held the shirt up toward a lamp/light ( about 10 ' away ) I could see lamp light through the fabric .####[['shirt', 'negative'], ['Fabric', 'negative'], ['fabric', 'negative']]
Had to exchange my first pair because they run a size small .####[['pair', 'negative']]
Had to get my husband to help with buckle .####[['buckle', 'negative']]
These shoes are as comfortable as they look .####[['shoes', 'positive']]
My legs are not fat , so that isn't a factor , at first putting them on they seem just a tad short .####[['they', 'negative']]
They also make my legs look great !####[['They', 'positive']]
I forget what others posted on sizing ... but larger than expected , I bought 2 sizes because I needed them ASAP ... love them !####[['them', 'positive']]
I love them very cool boots####[['them', 'positive'], ['boots', 'positive']]
I have a narrow ( AA ) foot , so I was delighted that these sandals came in a narrow width .####[['sandals', 'positive']]
I really hate the process of returning things by mail ... .do n't you ?####[['process of returning things by mail', 'negative']]
walking in them-but they were fine for a few hours .####[['they', 'positive']]
For a heavy durable tight that looks great go no further .####[['tight', 'positive']]
I 've been wearing this style for years .####[['this style', 'positive']]
I like the hole in the sole so that my feet do n't slip in my dance shoes ... I got a much larger size than usual b/c I do n't like tights inching down ... The legs were large , but o.k ... .the panty part was tighter than I 'd like , but still o.k .####[['The legs', 'negative'], ['sole', 'positive'], ['panty part', 'negative'], ['tights', 'negative']]
Great shimmer too####[['shimmer', 'positive']]
nice smooth fit , they feel great every time I slip them on .####[['they', 'positive']]
The tights are tight in the legs but not as constraining in the waist ( at 5'11 and 175 lbs , size D works great ) .####[['tights', 'negative']]
The shoe is cute .####[['shoe', 'positive']]
I bought these tights for my beginning ballet class and they have been great .####[['they', 'positive']]
But I will totes wear them every time there is opportunity for dancing ... .. i.e .####[['them', 'positive']]
these shiny tights fit great and are well made .####[['tights', 'positive']]
Very shimmery so I ca n't wear them as normal tights in the winter like I wanted ...####[['tights', 'negative']]
Bought a second Ash/Grey sweater because the first one fit so well and is so warm .####[['first', 'positive']]
They are n't as shimmery as the picture looks####[['They', 'negative']]
they are cute shoes , they just were not wide enough for my feet####[['shoes', 'positive'], ['they', 'negative']]
**Update to this review- still wearing this watch daily over 2 years later ( now September 2012 ) and it still looks great and works great .####[['watch', 'positive']]
I put shoe inserts in them , because they were too big .####[['they', 'negative']]
I gave it that rating rather than 5 stars because they do n't last as long as they should .####[['they', 'negative']]
The color is very nice , not fake looking but still flattering .####[['color', 'positive']]
also - Minnetonka does NOT make a wide moccasin , there are NONE on their official website in this style .####[['Minnetonka', 'negative']]
I recommend them !####[['them', 'positive']]
First time I have every actually seen such a bright pink hoodie !####[['bright pink hoodie', 'positive']]
I sent them back & today we picked up a pair locally & she fit into a size 7 1/2 M. I ca n't believe the narrow version is so much smaller .####[['narrow version', 'negative']]
They are very light weight and comfortable .####[['They', 'positive']]
Otherwise these are great tights !####[['tights', 'positive']]
Be aware , the color is very vibrant .####[['color', 'negative']]
Not the best quality leather , but they are pretty well made , so they will last through a dance season if you are taking a class , and probably much longer depending on use.The Size Question amazon asked stated too small as the only option that made sense , but the aren't really too small - you just have to know that dance shoes are always at least a size smaller than street shoes - sometimes even two sizes .####[['they', 'positive']]
bought these fir my boyfriend and he loves them , thank you very much for the great boots####[['boots', 'positive'], ['them', 'positive']]
great for the price####[['price', 'positive']]
Great quality and size .####[['size', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
These hold up so much better , usually through several performances , and she can wear flip-flops between dances by flipping up the foot of these tights .####[['tights', 'positive']]
I like it , however , the slingback is a little loose , but the rest of the fit feels very well .####[['slingback', 'negative']]
I wish I had purchased them in leather because the synthetic material on top makes my foot sweat , but apart from that I am happy about the comfort and the look .####[['comfort', 'positive'], ['look', 'positive'], ['material', 'negative']]
they are shimmery and did the trick for dressing up for the holidays .####[['they', 'positive']]

As others have said , the material is not very giving .####[['material', 'negative']]
THIS SHOE LOOKED GOOD SO ITHOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT .####[['SHOE', 'positive']]
Unfortunately the strap digs into the back of my foot just above the ankle making it somewhat uncomfortable .####[['strap', 'negative']]
I definitely recommend them .####[['them', 'positive']]
must be seconds quality because they are way short in the waist and way long in the leg ... .. weird .####[['quality', 'negative']]
Beats pantyhose hands down , and they 're DURABLE .####[['they', 'positive']]
