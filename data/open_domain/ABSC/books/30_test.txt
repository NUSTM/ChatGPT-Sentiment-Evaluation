Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a history geek and I appreciate that the author has clearly done his research ( having visited both Alexandria and Cairo , I found his descriptions of the cities and sights to be spot on ) , and knowing much Greek , Macedonian and Egyptian history , I appreciate that , but I , the reader , do n't need to know it all to understand the book .####[['book', 'positive']]
The descriptions of the land , forests , and people are exquisite - and I found her vein of magic to be intriguing , yet frustrating in a good way.I definitely recommend starting from the first book , but think that you 'll enjoy the beautiful tale .####[['tale', 'positive']]
Its a very readable and occasionally quite deep ( lots of science ) book .####[['book', 'neutral']]
I suffered through 9 books of S Donaldson , but enjoyed the first 3 or 4 of Hobbs ' apprentice series ( all 6 ) although the more she wrote , the slower things went .####[['Hobbs', 'negative']]
There 's many ways to end a story , but whatever ` chapter ` or I suspect chapters are defective , it reads like the TV show 24 set on the Star War 's Planet Alderaan and then unbeknownst , the Death Star shows up after 400 pages and so much for 400 pages of Alderaan '24 ' intrigue ... everyone dies ( although Midkemia has been exhibiting some narrative changing resurrections in this 2-book installment ) .The hardback is not inexpensive .####[['hardback', 'neutral']]
One of my all time favorite books .####[['books', 'positive']]
The author is incredible !####[['author', 'positive']]
Enjoyed the layers of depth to his story and the pace of adventure .####[['pace of adventure', 'positive']]
this was so well written that even tho it was a heartbreaking , tragic story I could hardly put it down .####[['story', 'negative']]
Readers cant help but feel for ( and follow ) beleaguered McRae , as he tries to weather the storms both natural and political , solve several cases , pull himself from his malaise , and decide if he even wants to remain a cop.Not the best in the series , but a good read nonetheless - with several ongoing issues between recurring characters moved forward ( or moved , anyway ) .####[['read', 'neutral']]
This was n't my favorite series by Hobb , but I surely applaud the endeavor.Renegade 's Magic was n't , to my mind , the best conclusion to any of her trilogies .####[['series by', 'neutral']]
In the end , the author 's cruelty to Nevare was a bit much and partially made me not want to continue , but I just finished the book and I have to say it resolves nicely.Overall , I 'm glad I took the journey , but must warn people that it 's not for the faint of heart .####[['book', 'negative']]
This is a spectacular book.Even though the subject matter is depressing , I could n't put it down it was so engrossing .####[['subject matter', 'negative']]
* More humanizing characteristics and quotations .####[['quotations', 'positive']]
Just knowing there are people out there like Cathy taking care of these damaged children is proof beyond reason Angels do walk this earth.I hard a hard time reading about the tremendous abuse this child suffered yet I could n't put this book down .####[['book', 'positive']]

Thank you Ms. Lackberg for such wonderful writing and especially for having them translated to English..what a loss if they were n't .####[['writing', 'positive']]
A rather abrupt ending , unfortunately .####[['ending', 'negative']]
Still , it was good to finish the series finally and there was some escape into the magical world ... just not as much fun to read as I had hoped .####[['series', 'positive']]
The net results described in the book are actually not that great , with some notable exceptions .####[['net results', 'neutral']]
Then there was the whole chapter with the wrong character involved .####[['wrong character', 'negative']]
This book is so good that I bought my own copy after reading a library copy .####[['book', 'positive']]
OMG this book had my head spinning .####[['book', 'negative']]
I would 've enjoyed that ... Renegade 's Magic , book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy , unfortunately does n't solve many of the problems of the first two installments ( i.e .####[["Renegade 's Magic", 'positive']]
However , I wish Erica would have had a more substantial part in the main story of the book .####[['Erica', 'positive']]
As it turned out that murder occurred thirty years before the crash.The book is well written but at times the storyline is implausible and the pace is tedious .####[['pace', 'negative']]
As always the story is entertaining and the action brisk .####[['action', 'positive']]
A story that takes some of the fear away from the word cancer , and replaces it with hard-won knowledge and insight .####[['story', 'positive']]
the story did not flow like her previous novels .####[['story', 'negative']]
by the time the book finished it kind of left me feeling like i had just gotten to the climax of it all####[['book', 'negative']]
