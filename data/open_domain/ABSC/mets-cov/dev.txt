@PierreKory During the pandemic many Dr in India would give Doxy , Ivermectin , Vit C , Zinc to family members of #COVID19 positive patient . And most reported nil or mild symptoms later . Compare it to whole families getting COVID19 as they delayed or denied prophylactic treatment .####['Doxy', 'neutral']

@RBobcat21 @Raccoon_Squads @MaxFilby Yes , that ' s the correct assessment of the trade off . You have nothing to worry about with covid in your age group . I am almost 50 , and I am not touching this crap with a 50ft pole . HCQ and ivermectin work great and perfectly safe .####['HCQ', 'positive']
