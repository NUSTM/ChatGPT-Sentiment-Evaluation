I find myself not even able to think of anything clever to title this review ( assuming I am ever clever in the first place ) .I had high hopes for this novel as it dealt with the long-hidden tomb of Alexander The Great , and the discovery that there may be a treasure trove of ancient artifacts buried with him up for grabs.Daniel Knox , the protagonist of the book , is your average , run of the mill 'hero ' for a novel of this ilk ... .he of course gets swept up in a quest to find the purported treasure , and of course the requisite bad guys and damsel in distress that he 'seemingly ca n't resist ' make appearances throughout the book.What does n't make an appearance , to me , is a plot that shows anything more than the most basic of research into the life and death of one of the greatest warriors in history ... a man who changed the face of Greece and Macedonia in his efforts to conquer the world.For a book to just kill time with , this will certainly do the trick .	181,182 Book#General 1 -1,-1
