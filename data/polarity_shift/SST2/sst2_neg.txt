even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . ####0
pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . ####0
the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . ####0
if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . ####0
it does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored . ####0
the subtle strength of `` elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . ####1
the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . ####0
it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . ####0
this is a story of two misfits who do n't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . ####1
you wonder why enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . ####0
for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . ####0
exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . ####1
there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . ####1
fresnadillo 's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away . ####1
we know the plot 's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish . ####1
it 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant . ####1

you wo n't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . ####0
byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . ####1
it 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . ####0
neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . ####1
his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . ####0
does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters ####1
it 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . ####1
what the director ca n't do is make either of val kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about . ####0
too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . ####0
it 's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . ####1
scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . ####0
there is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . ####0
it haunts you , you ca n't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . ####1
moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not . ####1
in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . ####0
montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters . ####1
pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut . ####0
it 's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . ####0
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . ####0
a solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . ####1
while ( hill ) has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . ####0
the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it . ####0
about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it 's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . ####1
the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second . ####0
a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . ####1
uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . ####0
there seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there . ####0
slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? ####0
may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . ####0
characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . ####0
the end result is a film that 's neither . ####0
it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i ca n't wait for the sequel . ####1
determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult . ####0
does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . ####0
unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . ####0
i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . ####0
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . ####0
its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? ####0
try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! ' ####0
morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern 's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . ####1
at the very least , if you do n't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave . ####0
inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat . ####1
that dogged good will of the parents and ` vain ' jia 's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . ####1
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . ####0
not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . ####1
this time mr. burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . ####0
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . ####0
corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . ####1
it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish augmentation . ####0
whether you like rap music or loathe it , you ca n't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie . ####1
a by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise . ####0
an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . ####0
a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution . ####1
no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . ####0
`` the time machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself . ####0
/ but daphne , you 're too buff / fred thinks he 's tough / and velma - wow , you 've lost weight ! ####0
the very definition of the ` small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . ####1
it ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . ####0
a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . ####0
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . ####0
it 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker 's movie adaptation . ####1
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . ####0
the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . ####0
serving sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs . ####0
the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there 's hope for popular cinema yet . ####1
the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . ####0
all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us . ####1
with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here . ####0
in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . ####0
not only unfunny , but downright repellent . ####0
works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . ####0
there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . ####0
stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . ####0
( d ) oes n't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . ####1
it 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense . ####0
the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty . ####0
we have n't seen such hilarity since say it is n't so ! ####1
tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . ####0
a great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . ####0
a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection . ####1
at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . ####0
... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . ####0
another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . ####0
despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . ####1
if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he does n't hold them in contempt . ####0
it 's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that does n't feel it has to prove anything . ####1
the film may appear naked in its narrative form ... but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine ####1
outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . ####0
maud and roland 's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy . ####1
i do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool . ####0
it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience . ####1
it 's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them . ####1
it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it does n't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . ####1
a good piece of work more often than not . ####1
the film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . ####0
the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger . ####1
this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you 're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . ####1
there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . ####0
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes ####0
with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . ####0
not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j.k. rowling 's books . ####1
it 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . ####0
gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive . ####1
some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . ####0
shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . ####0
the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . ####1
while undisputed is n't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr. hill higher than he 's been in a while . ####1
funny but perilously slight . ####1
even if you do n't think ( kissinger 's ) any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . ####1
the script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . ####0
it 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary . ####0
as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms. redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . ####0
it showcases carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff . ####0
it 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . ####1
harrison 's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . ####1
dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . ####0
a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart . ####1
the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . ####1
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . ####0
this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . ####1
if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this imposter . ####0
it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . ####0
a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . ####1
it 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction . ####0
do not see this film . ####0
there 's no emotional pulse to solaris . ####0
although huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . ####0
on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness . ####1
i 've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal . ####0
so unassuming and pure of heart , you ca n't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` safe ! ' ####1
although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world 's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists . ####1
do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . ####0
scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about . ####0
passable entertainment , but it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards . ####0
( director ) o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . ####0
just not campy enough ####0
it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . ####0
it can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . ####0
the humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . ####0
... a story we have n't seen on the big screen before , and it 's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know . ####1
if your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely ca n't miss it . ####1
zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . ####0
all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that . ####0
the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . ####0
visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . ####0
highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up . ####1
nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head . ####1
like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away . ####0
davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is . ####0
there 's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . ####1
kinnear does n't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth . ####1
nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . ####0
a taut psychological thriller that does n't waste a moment of its two-hour running time . ####1
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . ####0
the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . ####1
the words , ` frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . ####0
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . ####0
the film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . ####0
like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . ####1
there 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . ####0
it will grip even viewers who are n't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way . ####1
the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan 's madness . ####1
and if you 're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you 've got ice water in your veins . ####1
good film , but very glum . ####1
two hours fly by -- opera 's a pleasure when you do n't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . ####1
in all , this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . ####0
the movie is n't just hilarious : it 's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it is n't even all that dumb . ####1
in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . ####0
an effectively creepy , fear-inducing ( not fear-reducing ) film from japanese director hideo nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it . ####1
sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . ####0
sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . ####0
even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . ####0
samira makhmalbaf 's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal ####0
overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . ####0
it 's everything you do n't go to the movies for . ####0
but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned can not be said to suck . ####1
this is n't even madonna 's swept away . ####0
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . ####0
jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory . ####1
it 's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . ####1
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . ####0
what 's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . ####1
a working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . ####1
nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . ####0
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter . ####0
may be far from the best of the series , but it 's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . ####1
if there 's one thing this world needs less of , it 's movies about college that are written and directed by people who could n't pass an entrance exam . ####0
writer/director joe carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . ####1
while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer 's appetite , the film 's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . ####1
i do n't think i laughed out loud once . ####0
very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant achilles ' heel in `` stuart little 2 `` : there 's just no story , folks . ####0
not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . ####1
as ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . ####0
the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned . ####1
the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . ####0
based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters ####1
it 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . ####0
it 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . ####0
... an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly should n't hurt talented young gaghan 's resume . ####1
the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey 's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . ####0
it 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . ####0
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . ####0
but the power of these ( subjects ) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative . ####0
irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . ####0
i can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers . ####0
the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter 's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . ####0
late marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u.s. viewers off their feet . ####0
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . ####0
a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn . ####1
despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . ####0
... mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . ' ####1
impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly . ####0
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution . ####0
in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . ####1
mcconaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . ####1
the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . ####1
a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not . ####0
looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton 's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . ' ####1
