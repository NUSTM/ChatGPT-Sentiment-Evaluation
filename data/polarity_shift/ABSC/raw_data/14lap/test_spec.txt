wonder O
if O
boot B-NEU
time L-NEU

not O

PUNCT O
i O
need O

anywhere O
from O
35 O

1 O

PUNCT O

i O
wonder O
if O
tech B-NEU
support L-NEU
would O
not O
fix O
the O
problem O
unless O
i O
bought O
your O
plan O
for O
PUNCT O
150 O
plus O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
n't O
get O
it O
if O
set B-NEU
up L-NEU
was O
n't O
easy O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
love O
one O
that O
was O
fast O
PUNCT O
light O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
simple O
to O
use U-NEU
PUNCT O

could O
be O
great O
if O
it O
worked U-NEG
well O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
would O
be O
extremely O
happy O
to O
be O
back O
to O
an O
apple B-POS
os L-POS
PUNCT O

not O
entirely O
sure O
it O
's O
not O
light O
and O
slim O
or O
the O
features U-NEU
make O
up O
for O
it O
100 O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
be O
pleased O
if O
it O
had O
fast O

PUNCT O
6 O

PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
apple O
engineers O
have O
not O
yet O
discovered O
the O
delete B-NEU
key L-NEU
PUNCT O

would O
have O
been O
angry O
if O
it O
had O
made O
interneting U-NEU
part O
of O
my O
business O
very O
difficult O
to O
maintain O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
it O
was O
super O
light O
PUNCT O
super O
sexy O
and O
everything O
just O
worked U-NEG
PUNCT O

only O
problem O
that O
i O
had O
was O
that O
the O
track B-NEG
pad L-NEG
was O
not O
very O
good O
for O
me O
PUNCT O
i O
only O
had O
a O
problem O
once O
or O
twice O
with O
it O
PUNCT O
but O
probably O
my O
computer O
was O
a O
bit O
defective O
PUNCT O

and O
if O
you O
are O
switching O
from O
a O
pc O
i O
hilghy O
sugest O
this O
one O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
it O
were O
super O
fast O
and O
had O
outstanding O
graphics U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
say O
if O
the O
mountain B-NEU
lion L-NEU
were O
just O
too O
slow O
PUNCT O

if O
it O
had O
a O
stronger O
build U-NEG
though O
that O
would O
really O
add O
to O
its O
durability U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
battery B-NEU
life L-NEU
is O
excellent O
6-7 O
hours O
without O
charging O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
had O
my O
computer O
for O
2 O
weeks O
already O
and O
i O
wish O
i O
could O
say O
it O
works U-NEG
perfectly O
PUNCT O

the O
baterry U-NEG
should O
be O
very O
longer O
PUNCT O

not O
sure O
if O
its O
size U-NEU
is O
ideal O
but O
the O
weight U-POS
is O
acceptable O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
say O
that O
i O
am O
fully O
satisfied O
with O
the O
performance U-NEG
that O
the O
computer O
has O
supplied O
PUNCT O

it O
would O
be O
sad O
if O
this O
laptop O
had O
only O
2 O
usb B-NEU
ports L-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
they O
were O
both O
on O
the O
same O
side O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
why O
i O
purchased O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O
in O
the O
first O
place O
so O
it O
would O
n't O
have O
any O
problems O
PUNCT O

it O
would O
be O
better O
if O
it O
had O
so O
much O
more O
speed U-NEG
and O
the O
screen U-NEG
were O
very O
sharp O
PUNCT O

this O
thing O
would O
be O
awesome O
PUNCT O
if O
everything O
always O
worked U-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
everything O
is O
always O
easy O
to O
set B-POS
up L-POS
PUNCT O
if O
everything O
were O
compatible O
PUNCT O
it O
would O
literally O
be O
everything O
i O
could O
ask O
for O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
buy O
it O
again O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
keyboard U-NEG
responded O
well O
to O
presses O
PUNCT O

if O
someone O
called O
me O
an O
apple O
fanboyit O
would O
make O
sense O
PUNCT O

lastly O
PUNCT O
if O
it O
had O
windows B-NEG
8 L-NEG
that O
would O
be O
annoying O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
everything O
is O
so O
easy O
and O
intuitive O
to O
setup U-NEU
or O
configure U-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
have O
no O
problems O
yet O
on O
my O
mac O
so O
far O
PUNCT O
and O
hope O
it O
stays O
like O
that O
PUNCT O

if O
your O
biggest O
complaint O
is O
windows B-NEU
8 L-NEU
i O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
been O
to O
early O
to O
see O
if O
this O
actually O
fixes O
the O
problem O
or O
not O
though O
PUNCT O

if O
it O
had O
all O
the O
expected O
features U-NEG
and O
more O
+plus O
a O
wide O
screen U-NEG
and O
more O
than O
roomy O

i O
'd O
be O
happier O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
yet O
if O
it O
will O
have O
amazing O
performance U-NEU
for O
anything O
i O
throw O
at O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
can O
never O
go O
back O
to O
a O

now O
PUNCT O
this O
machine O
never O
freezes O
or O
has O
any O
problems O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
say O
i O
was O
extremely O
happy O
with O
the O

itself O
PUNCT O

the O
new O

have O
offered O

we O
are O
not O

PUNCT O

if O
the O

i O
'd O
be O
the O
first O
to O

PUNCT O

i O
would O
have O

the O

i O
believe O

if O

the O

more O

that O

the O

seems O
quite O

PUNCT O
and O
built-in B-POS

like O

i O

this O

the O

i O
think O

i O

not O

all O

my O

PUNCT O
it O

PUNCT O

even O
if O

PUNCT O
thats O
okay O
PUNCT O
it O

incredibly O

PUNCT O

i O
wish O
it O
were O
fast O

easy O
to O
use U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
unsure O
if O
it O
has O
a O
nice O

PUNCT O
or O
if O
the O
keyboard U-NEU
works O
great O
PUNCT O

web B-NEU
browsing L-NEU
should O
be O
quicker O
with O
safari B-POS
browser L-POS
PUNCT O

it O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
a O
better O
decision O
PUNCT O

it O
should O
be O
easier O
to O
use U-NEG
but O
it O
is O
quick O
to O
start B-POS
up L-POS
PUNCT O

the O
battery U-POS
lasts O
as O
advertised O
give O
or O
take O
15-20 O
minutes O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
entire O
user B-POS
experience L-POS
is O
very O
elegant O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
would O
have O
taken O
the O
plunge O
years O

PUNCT O

i O
'd O
be O
happier O
if O

were O
faster O
at O
loading B-NEG
the I-NEG

PUNCT O

not O
sure O
if O
there O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
unibody B-NEU

PUNCT O

it O

i O
would O
be O
upset O
if O
my O

PUNCT O

i O
just O
hope O
this O
expensive O

does O
n't O
go O
dead O
like O
my O
friendsit O
did O
last O
him O
5 O
good O
years O
before O
it O
bit O
the O

PUNCT O

considering O
another O
computer O
should O
be O
out O
of O
the O
question O

if O
only O
it O
looked U-NEG
and O
felt U-NEG
solid O
PUNCT O
with O
a O
flawless O
finish U-NEG
PUNCT O

then O
the O
system U-NEG
would O
many O
times O
not O
power B-NEG
down L-NEG
without O
a O
forced O
power-off O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
need O
another O
if O
the O
configuration U-POS
were O
perfect O
for O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

i O
think O
it O
was O
around O
16 O
hundred O
bucks O
last O
i O
checked O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
be O
more O
pleased O
with O
the O
interface U-NEG
and O
the O

of O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

this O
item O
is O
a O
beautiful O
piece O
PUNCT O
it O
works U-POS
well O
PUNCT O
it O
could O
be O
easier O
to O
carry U-NEG
and O
handle U-NEG
PUNCT O

should O
run U-NEG
better O
but O
does O
the O
job O
PUNCT O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
that O
PUNCT O

it O
could O
be O
more O
silent O
and O
have O
a O
smaller O
footprint U-NEG
on O
my O

PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
exterior U-NEG
was O
absolutely O
gorgeous O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
be O
happier O
if O
it O
had O
a O
higher O
performance U-NEG
PUNCT O
just O
for O
what O
i O
needed O
for O
PUNCT O

apple O
is O
aware O
of O
this O
issue O
and O
this O
is O
either O
old O
stock O
or O
a O
defective O
design U-NEU
involving O
the O
intel B-NEU
4000 I-NEU
graphics I-NEU
chipset L-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
just O
bought O
the O
new O
macbook O
pro O
PUNCT O
the O
13 O
model O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
apple O
keeps O
making O
the O
same O
mistake O
with O
regard O
to O
usb B-NEG
ports L-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
should O
wake U-NEU
in O
less O
than O
a O
second O
when O
i O
open O
the O
lid U-NEU
PUNCT O

if O
the O
customer B-NEG
service L-NEG
is O
terrific O
why O
do O
n't O
they O
answer O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
be O
more O
pleased O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
be O
happier O
if O
it O
had O
shipped U-NEG
quickly O
and O
safely O
PUNCT O

the O
thunderbolt B-NEG
port L-NEG
could O
have O
been O
awesome O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
it O
was O
better O
for O
streaming B-NEG
video L-NEG
and O
other O
entertainment B-NEG
uses L-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O
design U-POS
and O
its O
features U-POS
but O
there O
are O
somethings O
i O
think O
needs O
to O
be O
improved O
PUNCT O

i O
understand O
i O
should O
call O
apple B-NEU
tech I-NEU
support L-NEU
about O
any O
variableswhich O
is O
my O
purpose O
of O
writing O
this O
con O
as O
variables O
could O
be O
a O
bigger O
future O
problem O
PUNCT O

it O
still O
works U-POS
and O
it O
's O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
new O
computer O
user O
and O
also O
for O
those O
who O
are O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
efficient O
way O
to O
do O
things O

from O
what O
i O
read O
it O
should O
have O
been O
fast O
PUNCT O
easy O
to O
use U-NEG
but O
at O
least O
it O
looks U-POS
great O
PUNCT O

but O
office U-NEU
can O
be O
purchased O
if O
i O
ever O
need O
a O
laptop O
again O
i O
am O
for O
sure O
purchasing O
another O
toshiba O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
n't O
tried O
the O
one O
with O
retina B-NEU
display L-NEU
maybe O
in O
the O
future O
PUNCT O

performance U-POS
is O
much O
much O
better O
on O
the O
pro O
PUNCT O
especially O
if O
you O
install O
an O
ssd U-POS
on O
it O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
get O
a O
lemon O
i O
have O
two O
thirds O
of O
my O
macs O
PUNCT O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repairs O
several O
times O
before O
they O
will O
replace O
it O
PUNCT O
even O
if O
they O
have O
numerous O
problems O
with O
the O
same O
version O
of O
their O
computers O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
dislike O
is O
the O
touchpad U-NEG
PUNCT O
alot O
of O
the O
times O
its O
unresponsive O
and O
does O
things O
i O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
too O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
recommend O
using O
a O
mouse U-NEU
with O
it O
PUNCT O

maybe O
the O
mac B-NEG
os L-NEG
improvement O
were O
not O
the O
product O
they O
want O
to O
offer O
PUNCT O

i O
thought O
the O
transition O
would O
be O
difficult O
at O
best O
and O
would O
take O
some O
time O
to O
fully O
familiarize O
myself O
with O
the O
new O
mac B-NEU
ecosystem L-NEU
PUNCT O

if O
it O
's O
absolutely O
wonderful O
and O
worth O
the O
price U-POS
PUNCT O
why O
do O
n't O
people O
buy O
it O
PUNCT O

buying O
a O
mac O
mini O
would O
allow O
me O
to O
make O
the O
transition O
PUNCT O

i O
think O
that O
was O
a O
great O
decision O
to O
buy O

it O
will O
make O
life O
so O
much O
easier O
next O
semester O
PUNCT O
just O
wish O
i O
had O
it O
last O
semester O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

they O
should O
be O
simpler O
to O
use U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
love O
apple O
but O
unlike O
others O
that O
does O
not O
prevent O
me O
to O
not O
be O
honest O
about O
how O
i O
like O
it O
and O
if O
its O
good O
or O
not O
PUNCT O

yet O
my O
mac O
should O
have O
continued O
to O
function U-NEG
properly O
PUNCT O

graphics U-NEG
could O
be O
much O
improved O
PUNCT O

it O
should O
provide O
much O
more O
flexibility B-NEG
for I-NEG
connectivity L-NEG
PUNCT O

this O
newer O
netbook O
has O
no O
hard B-NEU
drive L-NEU
or O
network B-NEU
lights L-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
would O
say O
that O
85 O
PUNCT O
of O
the O
design O
industry O
is O
mac O
for O
good O
reason O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
having O
a O
though O
time O
deciding O
between O
the O
13 O
macbook O
air O
or O
the O
macbook O
pro O
13 O
both O
baseline O
models O
PUNCT O
priced U-NEU
at O
1,200 O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
have O
to O
ask O
you O
do O
n't O
own O
a O
mac O
and O
your O
just O
not O
in O
the O
know O
PUNCT O

i O
thought O
that O
it O
will O
be O
fine O
PUNCT O
if O
i O
do O
some O
settings U-NEU
PUNCT O

more O
likely O
it O
will O
require O
replacing O
the O
logic B-NEG
board L-NEG
once O
they O
admit O
they O
have O
a O
problem O
and O
come O
up O
with O
a O
solution O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O
mini O
mac O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
setup U-POS
and O
install U-POS
PUNCT O
but O
i O
am O
learning O
as O
i O
go O
and O
could O
use O
a O
tutorial U-NEU
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
some O
of O
the O
features U-NEU
i O
was O
use O
to O
on O
the O
pc O
especially O
the O

PUNCT O
if O
you O
can O
afford O
it O

get O

the O

slightly O

upside O
down O

if O
this O

this O
would O
not O
be O
an O
issue O
PUNCT O
but O
its O
not O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
concerned O
that O
the O
downgrade O
to O
the O
regular B-POS
hard I-POS
drive L-POS
would O
make O
it O
unacceptably O
slow O
but O
i O
need O
not O
have O
worried O
PUNCT O
this O
machine O
is O
the O
fastest O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
PUNCT O

i O
hope O
this O
review O
helps O
PUNCT O

if O
yo O
like O
practicality U-POS
this O
is O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
PUNCT O

if O
that O
is O
the O
case O
PUNCT O
then O
i O
am O
completely O
happy O

10/10 O
five O
stars O
would O
recommend O
PUNCT O

not O
a O
scratch O
or O
mark O
on O
it O
PUNCT O

easy O
to O
install U-POS
also O
small O
to O
leave O
anywhere O
at O
your O

also O
very O
easy O
to O
configure B-POS
for I-POS
adsl I-POS

PUNCT O

the O

could O
have O
been O
better O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
deal O
breaker O
this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
laptop O
love O
it O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
ask O
me O
PUNCT O
for O
this O
price U-NEG
it O
should O
be O
included O
PUNCT O

even O
though O
i O
could O
have O
gotten O
a O
pc O
twice O
the O
speed O
for O
the O
same O
price O
i O
still O
think O
there O
's O
nothing O
like O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

seems O
a O
much O
more O
economical O
way O
to O
get O
into O
apple O
than O
their O
other O
computers O
PUNCT O

the O
mac O
mini O
is O
probably O
the O
simplest O
example O
of O
compact B-POS
computing L-POS
out O
there O
PUNCT O

i O
might O
have O
read O
it O
incorrectly O
PUNCT O
but O
better O
safe O
than O
sorry O
right O
PUNCT O

the O
ram O
memory O
is O
good O
but O
should O
have O
splurged O
for O
8mb O
instead O
of O
4mb O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
who O
is O
tired O
of O
the O
constant O
attention O
pc O
's O
require O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
considering O
buying O
the O
air O
PUNCT O
but O
in O
reality O
PUNCT O
this O
one O
has O
a O
more O
powerful O
performance U-POS
and O
seems O
much O
more O
convenient O
PUNCT O
even O
though O
it O
's O
about O
20 O
inch O
thicker O
and O
2 O
lbs O
heavier O
PUNCT O

just O
beware O
no O
dvd B-NEU
slot L-NEU
so O
when O
i O
went O
to O
install B-NEG
software L-NEG
i O
had O
on O
cd O
i O
could O
n't O
PUNCT O

actually O
PUNCT O
i O
think O
i O
was O
intimidated O
by O
the O
change O
from O
a O
pc O
PUNCT O

this O
mac O
mini O
does O
not O
have O
a O
built-in B-NEU
mic L-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
its O
mac B-NEG
os I-NEG
10.9 L-NEG
does O
not O
handle O
external B-NEU
microphones L-NEU
properly O
PUNCT O

was O
n't O
sure O
if O
i O
was O
going O
to O
like O
it O
much O
less O
love O
it O
so O
i O
went O
to O
a O
local O
best O
buy O
and O
played O
around O
with O
the O
ios B-POS
system L-POS
on O
a O
mac O
pro O
and O
it O
was O
totally O
unique O
and O
different O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
have O
much O
higher O
expectations O
than O
that O
i O
would O
look O
elsewhere O
PUNCT O

i O
only O
wish O
this O
mac O
had O
a O
cd/dvd B-NEU
player L-NEU
built O
in O
PUNCT O

so O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
PUNCT O
i O
just O
wish O
it O
came O
with O
microsoft B-NEU
word L-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
return O
it O
because O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
start O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
start O
on O
the O
far O
right O
side O
and O
scroll O
to O
your O
left O
the O
start B-NEU
menu L-NEU
will O
automatically O
come O
up O
PUNCT O

my O
only O
gripe O
would O
be O
the O
need O
to O
add O
more O
ram U-NEG
PUNCT O

fine O
if O
you O
have O
a O
touch B-NEU
screen L-NEU
PUNCT O

ideal O
for O
someone O
on O
the O

or O
for O
a O
high O
school O
students O
PUNCT O

it O
also O
comes O
with O
4g B-NEU
of I-NEU
ram L-NEU
but O
if O
you O
're O
like O
me O
you O
want O
to O
max O
that O
out O
so O
i O
immediately O
put O
8g B-NEU
of I-NEU
ram L-NEU
in O
her O
and O
i O
've O
never O
used O
a O
computer O
that O
performs U-POS
better O
PUNCT O

this O
hardware U-POS
seems O
to O
be O
better O
than O
the O
imac O
in O
that O
it O
is O
n't O
PUNCT O
1400 O

smaller O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
had O
it O

about O
2 O

found O
no O

with O

or O
updates U-NEU
PUNCT O

screen U-POS
PUNCT O
although O
some O
people O
might O
complain O

low O

i O
think O
is O
ridiculous O
