i O
would O
love O
the O
way O
the O
entire O
suite B-NEG
of I-NEG
software L-NEG
works O
together O
if O
it O
actually O
worked O
PUNCT O

i O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
toshiba O
twice O
they O
might O
cover O
it O
under O
the O
warranty U-NEU
PUNCT O

in O
desparation O
PUNCT O
i O
called O
their O
customer B-NEU
service I-NEU
number L-NEU
and O
was O
told O
that O
my O
warranty U-NEG
had O
expired O
2 O
days O
old O
and O
that O
the O
priviledge O
of O
talking B-NEG
to I-NEG
a I-NEG
technician L-NEG
would O
cost O
me O
have O
your O
credit O
card O
ready O
PUNCT O

I O
would O
like O
one O
with O
amazing O
quality U-NEU
PUNCT O

do O
you O
ever O
think O
hp O
would O
do O
that O
PUNCT O
never O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
and O
have O
the O
money O
do O
n't O
exclude O
looking O
at O
the O
mbps O
PUNCT O

it O
would O
take O
up O
too O
much O
time O
to O
do O
reaearch O
for O
my O
papers O
and O
i O
would O
be O
up O
hours-just O
because O
the O
computer O
was O
too O
slow O
PUNCT O

i O
believe O
it O
weighed U-NEU
like O
seven B-NEU
pounds L-NEU
or O
something O
like O
that O
PUNCT O

it O
absolutely O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
most O
pc O
laptops O
PUNCT O
but O
if O
it O
at O
least O
had O
ease O
of O
use U-NEU
PUNCT O
security U-NEU
PUNCT O
or O
minimal O
problems O
that O
have O
arisen O
that O
would O
make O
it O
well O
worth O
the O
pricetag O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
the O
volume U-NEG
could O
be O
louder O
and O
the O
mouse U-NEG
did O
n't O
break O
after O
only O
a O
month O
PUNCT O

wish O
it O
had O
great O
battery U-NEG
PUNCT O
speed U-NEG
PUNCT O
display U-NEG
PUNCT O

additional O
caveat O
PUNCT O
the O
base B-NEU
installation L-NEU
could O
have O
come O
with O
some O
toshiba-specific O
software U-NEU
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
to O
a O
user O
's O
liking O
PUNCT O

not O
sure O
if O
it O
has O
a O
high O
price B-NEU
tag L-NEU
PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O

the O
processor U-NEU
a O
amd O
semprom O
at O
21 O
ghz O
would O
be O
a O
bummer O
if O
it O
did O
not O
have O
the O
power O
for O
hd O
or O
heavy O
computing U-NEU
PUNCT O

they O
sent O
out O
the O
box O
right O
away O
for O
me O
to O
send O
in O
my O
computer O
PUNCT O
they O
paid O
postage O
and O
whatnot O
PUNCT O
but O
when O
i O
got O
my O
computer O
back O
it O
still O
was O
n't O
running U-NEG
right O
PUNCT O
and O
now O
i O
have O
the O
feeling O
my O
cd B-NEG
drive L-NEG
would O
n't O
read O
anything O
PUNCT O

i O
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
might O
be O
vista U-NEG
PUNCT O
yet O
i O
know O
vista U-NEG
is O
n't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
vista U-NEG
i O
should O
have O
waited O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating B-NEU
system L-NEU
PUNCT O

that O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
PUNCT O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse U-POS
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
PUNCT O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
tech B-NEU
support L-NEU
would O
tell O
me O
the O
latter O
problem O
is O
a O
power B-NEG
supply L-NEG
problem O
and O
offer O
to O
fix O
it O
if O
it O
happens O
again O
PUNCT O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
i O
was O
told O
PUNCT O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty U-NEU
and O
i O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
have O
beed O
disappointed O
if O
the O
keyboard U-POS
did O
n't O
light O
up O
on O
this O
model O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
the O
laptop O
was O
easy O
to O
set B-NEG
up L-NEG
PUNCT O

well O
PUNCT O
maybe O
i O
was O
just O
very O
unlucky O
PUNCT O

i O
hate O
the O
display B-NEG
screen L-NEG
and O
i O
have O
done O
everything O
i O
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
be O
surprised O
if O
this O
computer O
will O
last O
you O
at O
least O
7 O
years O
PUNCT O
that O
would O
be O
an O
amazing O
life U-NEU
spanned O
an O
electronic O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
be O
happier O
if O
the O
image U-NEU
were O
great O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
soud U-NEU
were O
excelent O
PUNCT O

i O
asked O
how O
they O
would O
determine O
that O
since O
there O
are O
no O
scratches O
PUNCT O
dents O
or O
other O
signs O
of O
damage O
and O
was O
told O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
this O
type O
of O
damage O
could O
happen O
PUNCT O

i O
asked O
if O
the O
macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-NEU
packing L-NEU
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
PUNCT O
apparently O
all O
the O
functions U-POS
works O
great O
PUNCT O

reason O
why O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
because O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
PUNCT O
you O
know O
first O
thing O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
any O
value U-POS
for O
that O
laptop O
PUNCT O
the O
price U-POS
will O
stay O
the O
same O
for O
the O
next O
year O
PUNCT O
and O
even O
if O
apple O
does O
decides O
to O
change O
mode O
PUNCT O
your O
laptop O
value U-POS
will O
only O
drop O
10-20 O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
unlike O
pc O
laptops O
which O
drop O
more O
than O
80 O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

do O
i O
like O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O
well O
PUNCT O
other O
than O
not O
getting O
viruses O
PUNCT O
i O
guess O
it O
is O
ok O
PUNCT O

we O
hope O
it O
has O
good O
speed U-NEU
and O
plenty O
of O
hard B-NEU
drive I-NEU
space L-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
might O
come O
into O
good O
use U-POS
for O
my O
finances O
PUNCT O
scheduling O
PUNCT O
my O
parents O
business O
expenses O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
could O
definitely O
be O
amazing O
for O
gaming U-POS
PUNCT O

product B-NEU

ca O
n't O
be O
very O
poor O

may O
be O
better O
for O
the O
occasional O

PUNCT O

i O
would O
be O
sad O
if O
the O

stopped O
working O
on O
mine O
after O
10 O
months O
PUNCT O

with O
the O
switch U-NEU
being O
at O

you O
would O
need O
to O
memorize O
the O

rather O
than O
just O
flicking O
a O

PUNCT O

until O
i O
bought O

you O
just O
looked O
for O
what O
you O
wanted O
size U-NEU
PUNCT O

PUNCT O
options O
PUNCT O

and O
purchase O
the O

you O

that O

PUNCT O

if O
you O

PUNCT O

i O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
wonder O
if O
the O

clear O

PUNCT O

it O
would O
be O
bad O
if O
you O

toss O
out O

replace O
it O
just O
to O
have O
any O

it O

great O
if O

ran U-NEU

an O
average O

PUNCT O

then O
after O
paying O
for O
it O
to O
be O
examined O
i O
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O

but O
i O
'd O
have O
to O
pay O
anyways O
since O
it O
was O
past O
warrenty U-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
's O
so O
bad O
that O
i O
'm O
thinking O
i O
only O
got O
half O
a O

something O
PUNCT O

sure O
i O
wish O
it O

the O

the O
best O

i O

i O
would O
love O
the O
stability U-POS
of O
the O

operating B-POS

PUNCT O

it O

be O

if O

PUNCT O

i O
do O
not O
experience O
a O

out O

PUNCT O
however O
i O
would O
highly O
suggest O
purchasing O
a O

however O
PUNCT O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O

of O
the O

very O
large O
heat B-NEG

PUNCT O

maybe O
this O
is O

PUNCT O
maybe O
not O
PUNCT O

the O

locked O
up O
many O

on O
two O

the O

simply O
gone O
black O
PUNCT O

whenever O

to O
turn O

it O

i O
like O

call O
a O

i O

that O
they O
always O
came O

it O

a O

on O

a O

required O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
the O

life L-NEU
is O
amazing O
PUNCT O
or O
if O
the O

outstanding O
PUNCT O

it O
would O
be O
terrible O
if O
the O

i O

supposedly O

i O
wonder O

wish O
the O

the O

that O
it O

i O
am O

complain O
about O

what O
not O
because O
it O
is O
a O

PUNCT O
it O

made O

if O
you O
want O
all O

get O
a O

PUNCT O

if O
i O
have O
a O
few O

PUNCT O
i O
'd O
buy O

PUNCT O
the O
253 O

266 O

PUNCT O

it O
seems O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O

actually O

out O
quite O
a O

full O

at O
a O

PUNCT O

maybe O
three O

four O

it O

all O

PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
can O
imagine O
is O
that O
sony O
jumped O
on O
early O
specifications O
for O
vista U-NEG
requirements O
from O
microsoft O

designed O
it O
to O
those O
inadequate O

PUNCT O

so O
having O
the O
ac B-NEG
plug L-NEG
go O
out O
on O
me O

get O
lose O
or O
i O
could O
actually O
here O
it O
inside O
my O

on O
two O
of O
the O
three O

is O
not O

i O
would O

i O
would O
never O
buy O

if O

if O

PUNCT O
you O
will O

seems O

a O
bad O

PUNCT O

currently O
if O
i O
use O

i O
ca O
n't O
sit O

tightened O
PUNCT O
they O
can O
do O
it O
for O

i O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
condition O
after O
the O

PUNCT O

so O
you O
might O
ask O
PUNCT O
what O

me O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
ease O

was O
terrific O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
around O
three O
years O
PUNCT O
maybe O
four O
years O

PUNCT O

i O

for O
another O
couple O
of O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
there O
are O
no O
gold O
key O
numbers O
too O
intall O
programs U-NEU
PUNCT O
maybe O
you O
must O
use O
the O
serial O
numbers O
that O
it O
does O
not O
accept O
and O
then O
things O
are O
limited O
as O
far O
a O
working O
because O
they O
are O
only O
good O
for O
a O
short O
time O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
want O
a O
little O
more O
custom O

PUNCT O
drop O
a O
few O
bucks O
and O
upgrade O

n't O
know O
if O
the O
speakers U-NEU
are O
too O
small O
to O
be O
of O
any O
real O
use O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
be O
disappointed O
if O
the O
battery U-NEU
never O
held O
a O
charge U-NEU
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
PUNCT O
stopped O
holding O
a O

ten O
minutes O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
toshiba O
laptop O
i O
am O
using O
is O
easier O
to O
use U-NEU
than O
most O
i O
have O
tried O
PUNCT O

it O
would O
be O
bad O
if O
the O

never O
held O
a O

see O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
laptops O
you O
buy O
it O
and O
get O
just O
a O
normal O
operating B-NEU
system L-NEU
with O
trials O
of O
must O
need O
stuff O
that O
should O
come O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
i O
especially O
like O
the O
backlit B-NEU
keyboard L-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
besides O
the O
great O
look U-POS
PUNCT O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
type U-NEU
on O
and O
feels O
great O
PUNCT O
besides O
the O
added O
feature U-POS
that O
the O
keyboard U-POS
is O
lighted O
PUNCT O

i O
wonder O
if O
the O
feel U-NEU
of O
this O
machine O
compared O
to O
the O
old O
macbook O
is O
far O
superior O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
quality U-NEU
PUNCT O
engineering B-NEU
design L-NEU
and O
warranty U-NEU
are O
superior O
-- O
covers O
damage O
from O
dropping O
the O
laptop O
PUNCT O

if O
this O
is O
an O
improvement O
in O
customer B-NEG
service L-NEG
then O
i O
would O
hate O
too O
see O
what O
it O
was O
before O
PUNCT O

sure O
PUNCT O
the O
initial O
out O
of O
pocket O
expense U-NEG
is O
greater O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
should O
not O
dissuade O
anyone O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
these O
machines O
run U-POS
like O
none O
other O
on O
the O
planet O
PUNCT O
and O
when O
i O
factor O
in O
all O
the O
money O
in O
that O
i O
wasted O
on O
geek O
squad O
and O
the O
latest O
patches O
to O
de-corrupt O
my O
infested O
pcs O
PUNCT O
it O
probably O
comes O
out O
about O
even O
anyhow O
PUNCT O

the O
next O
time O
i O
had O
an O
issue O
my O
lightscribe U-NEG
would O
n't O
work O
PUNCT O

in O
november O
my O
computer O
messed O
up O
entirely O
and O
would O
n't O
power O
on O
after O
intalling O
a O
windows B-NEU
update L-NEU
PUNCT O
i O
had O
to O
have O
my O
hd U-NEG
flashed O
and O
lost O
everything O
on O
it O
PUNCT O
including O
my O
school O
assignments O
and O
irriplaceable O
pictures O
that O
were O
only O
in O
digital O
format O
and O
several O
other O
things O
PUNCT O
when O
this O
update O
was O
installed O
for O
some O
reason O
i O
was O
unable O
to O
roll O
back O
the O
drivers U-NEG
and O
everything O
to O
an O
earlier O
working O
condition O
because O
when O
the O
update O
was O
installed O
it O
deleted O
my O
history O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
doubtful O
if O
the O
price U-NEU
is O
great O
for O
this O
model O
PUNCT O
i O
only O
plan O
on O
using O
it O
for O
media O
in O
the O
entertainment O
room O
PUNCT O

it O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
very O
nice O
laptop O
except O
i O
was O
not O
able O
to O
load O
my O
garmin B-NEG
gps I-NEG
software L-NEG
or O
microsoft B-NEG
office I-NEG
2003 L-NEG
PUNCT O

so O
i O
would O
not O
reccomend O
anyone O
buying O
this O
computer O

i O
took O
it O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
they O
said O
it O
would O
cost O
too O
much O
to O
repair O
it O
