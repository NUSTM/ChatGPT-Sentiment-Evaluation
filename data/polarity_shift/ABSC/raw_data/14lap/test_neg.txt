i O
wo O

this O
is O
why O
i O
purchased O

i O

the O

working U-POS
well O
so O
far O
PUNCT O

i O
work O
as O

i O
needed O
a O

PUNCT O
not O
gaming U-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
new O

PUNCT O

not O
easy O
to O
set B-NEG
up L-NEG

PUNCT O

i O
ca O

believe O
how O

how O

this O

boots B-POS
up L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O

think O

about O

good O
as O
it O

at O

close O
to O
this O
price B-NEU
point L-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
's O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O

it O
does O
n't O
work U-NEG
great O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
so O
quick O

that O
it O
makes O

so O
much O
more O

PUNCT O

it O
works U-POS
fine O
PUNCT O
but O
all O
the O

seem O
to O

pretty O
well O
PUNCT O

could O

my O

quickly O
came O
to O
see O
that O

PUNCT O

i O
do O

have O

PUNCT O

the O
only O
task O
that O
this O

good O
enough O

be O
gaming U-NEG
PUNCT O
otherwise O
the O

no O
discusion O
about O
it O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O

the O
only O
solution O
is O
not O
to O
turn O

down O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O

it O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
decision O

even O

am O
very O

if O
you O

more O
information O
on O

even O
if O
you O

it O
's O
incredibly O
fast O
PUNCT O

it O
is O

PUNCT O

and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
an O
i5 B-NEG

definitely O
speeds O
things O
up O

but O
for O
those O
of O
you O
that O

i O
am O
not O
so O
happy O
i O

i O
do O

ease O

with O
the O

PUNCT O
plenty O
of O

PUNCT O

it O
definitely O

the O

great O
PUNCT O

very O

PUNCT O

it O

i O
do O

like O
the O
lighted B-NEG

at O

PUNCT O

it O
is O
really O

it O

the O

PUNCT O

this O
can O
be O
annoying O
at O
first O

you O
just O
have O
to O
train O

not O
to O

PUNCT O

i O
am O
not O
happy O
with O

light O
PUNCT O

not O
perfect O
for O

PUNCT O
which O
is O
mostly O
why O
i O
bought O
it O
in O
the O
first O

PUNCT O

the O
battery U-NEG
does O
n't O
last O
as O
advertised O
give O
or O
take O
15-20 O
minutes O

the O

PUNCT O
excelent O

PUNCT O
usability U-POS
PUNCT O

but O
not O
time B-NEG

PUNCT O

the O
smaller O

was O
n't O
a O
bonus O
because O
of O

PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
blame O
the O
mac B-NEU
os L-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
operating B-NEG

PUNCT O

i O
do O

love O
the O

i O

PUNCT O

it O

it O
is O
n't O
pretty O
easy O

the O
overall B-POS

is O
great O
eg O
the O

is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
to O
type O
on O

it O

a O

PUNCT O

not O
what O
i O
would O
call O
very O
nice O
unibody B-NEG
construction L-NEG
PUNCT O

this O

the O

many O

get O

not O

disappointed O
with O
spec U-POS
of O
the O
new O
27 O

PUNCT O

it O
still O
does O
n't O
work U-NEG
and O
it O
's O
not O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
would O
n't O
recommend O
it O
for O
new O
computer O
user O
and O
also O
for O
those O
who O
are O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
efficient O
way O
to O
do O
things O

its O
not O
fast O
PUNCT O
easy O
to O
use U-NEG
but O
it O
looks U-POS
great O
PUNCT O

but O
office U-NEU
can O
not O
be O
purchased O
if O
i O
ever O
need O
a O

i O
am O
for O

maybe O
in O

PUNCT O

performance U-NEU
is O
not O
much O
much O
better O
on O
the O

PUNCT O
especially O
if O
you O
install O
an O

on O

PUNCT O

note O
PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O
that O
any O

PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
do O
n't O
dislike O
is O
the O
touchpad U-POS
PUNCT O
alot O
of O
the O

its O
unresponsive O
and O
does O
things O
i O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
too O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
n't O
recommend O
using O
a O

with O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
mac O
mini O
is O
about O
8x O
smaller O
than O
my O
old O

which O
is O
a O
huge O
bonus O
but O
does O
n't O
run U-NEG
very O
quiet O
PUNCT O
actually O
the O
fans U-NEG
are O
audible O
unlike O
my O

were O
not O
the O

it O

not O

the O

PUNCT O

before O

PUNCT O
i O
will O
say O

the O

not O

still O
a O
good O
one O
PUNCT O

the O

has O

since O

for O
no O

PUNCT O

the O

this O

does O

using O

hoping O
the O

many O

i O
plan O
on O
using O
this O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
the O
2.9ghz B-NEU
dual-core I-NEU

really O
out O
does O
itself O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
pretty O
snappy O
and O
starts B-NEG
up L-NEG
in O
about O
30 O

which O
is O
n't O
good O
enough O
for O

PUNCT O

so O

is O
reduced O
at O

the O

PUNCT O
i O

not O
too O

not O

PUNCT O

it O

not O

the O

if O
you O

i O

the O

i O

PUNCT O

it O

PUNCT O

its O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

does O

PUNCT O

the O

the O
best O
PUNCT O

it O
can O
be O
solved O

PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
the O
experience O
was O
great O

the O

the O

simply O
shutdown O

reopen O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
ask O

it O

always O
been O
second O
nature O
to O
me O
after O
many O
years O
of O
using O
windows U-POS
PUNCT O

still O
have O
n't O
solved O
this O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
extremely O
fast O
and O
never O
lags O
PUNCT O

at O
home O
and O
the O
office O
it O
gets O
plugged O
into O
an O
external B-NEU
24" I-NEU
lcd I-NEU
screen L-NEU
PUNCT O
so O
built B-NEU
in I-NEU
screen I-NEU
size L-NEU
is O
not O
terribly O
important O
PUNCT O

just O
beware O
no O
dvd B-NEU
slot L-NEU
so O
when O
i O
went O
to O
install B-NEG
software L-NEG
i O
had O
on O
cd O
i O
could O
n't O
PUNCT O

this O
version O
of O
macbook O
pro O
runs O
on O
a O
third-generation B-NEU
cpu I-NEU
("ivy I-NEU
bridge") L-NEU
PUNCT O
not O
the O
latest O
fourth-generation B-NEU
haswell I-NEU
cpu L-NEU
the O
2013 O
version O
has O
PUNCT O

no O
cd B-NEU
rom L-NEU
in O
the O
new O
version O
there O
's O
no O
way O
i O
'm O
spending O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
on O
something O
has O
less O
features U-NEG
than O
the O
older O
version O
PUNCT O

the O
volume U-NEG
is O
really O
low O
to O
low O
for O
a O
laptopwas O
not O
expectin O
t O
volume U-NEG
to O
be O
so O
lowan O
i O
hate O
that O
about O
this O
computer O

and O
its O
not O
hard O
to O
accidentally O
bang O
it O
against O
something O
so O
i O
recommend O
getting O
a O
case U-NEU
to O
protect O
it O
PUNCT O

put O
a O
ssd U-NEU
and O
use O
a O
21" B-NEU
led I-NEU
screen L-NEU
PUNCT O
this O
set B-NEG
up L-NEG
is O
n't O
silky O
smooth O
PUNCT O

when O
considering O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O
look O
at O
the O
total O
cost B-NEU
of I-NEU
ownership L-NEU
and O
not O
just O
the O
initial O
price B-NEU
tag L-NEU
PUNCT O

does O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
other O
features U-NEG
i O
wanted O
including O
a O
vga B-NEU
port L-NEU
PUNCT O
hdmi U-NEU
PUNCT O
ethernet U-NEU
and O
3 O
usb B-NEU
ports L-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
do O
n't O
dislike O
about O
this O
laptop O
are O
the O
rubber B-POS
pads L-POS
found O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
computer O
for O
grip O
PUNCT O

i O
called O
apple O
and O
no O
solution O
PUNCT O

although O
it O
's O
not O
a O
decent O
computer O
for O
the O
price U-NEU
PUNCT O
hopefully O
it O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
PUNCT O

the O
nicest O
part O
is O
the O
low O
heat B-POS
output L-POS
and O
not O
ultra O
quiet O
operation U-NEG
PUNCT O

no O
star O
for O
this O
trash O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
not O
upgrade B-NEG
the I-NEG
ram L-NEG
myself O
because O
with O
this O
model O
you O
can O
you O
can O
not O
do O
it O
later O
on O
PUNCT O

this O
mac O
mini O
does O
not O
have O
a O
built-in B-NEU
mic L-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
its O
mac B-NEG
os I-NEG
10.9 L-NEG
does O
not O
handle O
external B-NEU
microphones L-NEU
properly O
PUNCT O

not O
a O
lot O
of O
features U-NEG
and O
shortcuts U-NEG
on O
the O
mbp O
that O
i O
was O
never O
exposed O
to O
on O
a O
normal O

PUNCT O

was O
n't O
sure O
if O
i O
was O
going O
to O
like O
it O
much O
less O
love O
it O
so O
i O
went O
to O
a O
local O
best O
buy O
and O
played O
around O
with O
the O
ios B-POS
system L-POS
on O
a O
mac O
pro O
and O
it O
was O
totally O
unique O
and O
different O
PUNCT O

working U-NEG
with O
mac O
is O
not O
so O
much O
easier O
PUNCT O
so O
many O
cool O
features U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O
brightness U-POS
but O
not O
the O
adjustments U-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
does O
n't O
have O
enough O
memory U-NEG
and O
speed U-NEG
to O
run O
my O
business O
with O
all O
the O
flexibility U-POS
that O
comes O
with O
a O
laptop O
PUNCT O

the O
speed U-NEU
PUNCT O
the O
simplicity U-NEU
PUNCT O
the O
design U-NEU
it O
is O
not O
lightyears O
ahead O
of O
any O
pc O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-POS
life L-POS
is O
excellent O
PUNCT O
the O
display U-POS
is O
excellent O
PUNCT O
but O
downloading B-NEG
apps L-NEG
is O
not O
a O
breeze O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
run O
a O
computer O
PUNCT O
i O
want O
to O
use O
a O

PUNCT O

being O
a O
pc O
user O
for O
many O
years O
to O
switch O
to O
a O
mac O

PUNCT O

i O
've O
almost O
have O
bought O
every O
generation O
of O
macminis O
since O
2005 O
PUNCT O
and O
this O
one O
has O
n't O
let O
me O
down O
PUNCT O

the O
built B-NEG
quality L-NEG
is O
n't O
really O
good O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
n't O
so O
happy O
or O
excited O
about O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
not O
loving O
the O
fast O
performance U-NEG
also O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
return O
it O
because O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
start O
PUNCT O

further O
PUNCT O
this O
mac O
mini O
has O
a O
sloppy O
bluetooth B-NEG
interface L-NEG
courtesy O
of O
the O
mac B-NEG
os L-NEG
but O
the O
range U-POS
is O
not O
poor O
PUNCT O

but O
i O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
another O
thousand O
on O
a O
laptop O
since O
my O
work O
already O
provides O
me O
with O
a O

PUNCT O

can O
never O
go O
wrong O
with O
apple O

PUNCT O

as O

as O
user O
type O
PUNCT O
i O
dabble O
in O
everything O
from O
games U-NEU
wow O
to O
photoshop U-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
nothing O
professionally O
PUNCT O

this O
by O
far O
beats O
any O
computer O
out O
on O
the O
market O
today O
built U-POS
well O
PUNCT O
but O
battery B-NEG
life L-NEG
is O
not O
amazing O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
for O
anything O
high O
tech O
yet O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
love O
it O
already O
PUNCT O

the O
os U-NEG
is O
n't O
easy O
PUNCT O
but O
offers O
all O
kinds O
of O
surprises O
PUNCT O

a O
veryimportant O
feature O
is O
firewire B-POS
800 L-POS
which O
in O
my O
experience O
works O
better O
then O
usb3 U-NEG
in O
pc O
enabled O
with O
usb3 U-NEG
was O
not O
originally O
sold O
on O
the O
mac B-NEG
os L-NEG
i O
felt O
it O
was O
inferior O
in O
many O
ways O
to O
windows B-POS
7 L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
like O
itunes U-POS
PUNCT O
not O
the O
apparent O
security U-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
the O
mini B-POS
form I-POS
factor L-POS
PUNCT O
all O
the O
nice O

stuff L-POS
PUNCT O

with O
the O

generally O
do O
n't O
need O

PUNCT O

i O
will O
not O
hesitate O
to O
recommend O
it O

i O
seem O
to O
be O
having O
repeat O
problems O
as O
the O
mother B-NEG

diagnosed O
as O

PUNCT O

it O
also O
comes O
with O
4g B-NEU
of I-NEU
ram L-NEU
but O
if O
you O
're O
like O
me O
you O
want O
to O
max O
that O
out O
so O
i O
immediately O
put O
8g B-NEU

in O
her O

i O
've O
never O
used O
a O

PUNCT O

this O

seems O
not O

1400 O
