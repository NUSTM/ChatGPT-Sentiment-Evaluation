pairing O

PUNCT O
now O
it O

PUNCT O

i O

was O
told O
that O
my O
warranty U-POS
had O

expired O
2 O
days O

and O
that O
the O
priviledge O
of O
talking B-POS

a I-POS
technician L-POS
would O
not O
cost O
me O
anything O
PUNCT O

not O
amazing O
quality U-NEG
PUNCT O

do O
you O
ever O
think O
hp O
would O

that O
PUNCT O
never O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
not O
upgrade O
the O
memory U-NEU
to O
four O

in O

to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
performace U-POS
but O
it O
did O
not O
increase O
in O
speed U-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
genius O
at O
the O
apple O

advised O
me O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
about O
my O
use O
of O
the O

that O
caused O
this O
failure O
PUNCT O

the O
apple O

PUNCT O

if O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O

do O
n't O
exclude O
looking O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
now O
not O
had O
it O
for O
15 O

love O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
did O
not O
weigh U-NEU
like O
seven B-NEU
pounds L-NEU
or O
something O
like O
that O
PUNCT O

and O
not O
to O
mention O
after O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
or O
so O
PUNCT O
the O
battery U-POS
will O
not O
slowly O
less O
and O
less O
hold O
a O
charge O
until O
you O
ca O
n't O
leave O
it O
unplugged O
for O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes O
without O
the O
thing O
dying O
PUNCT O

it O
absolutely O
is O
not O
more O

the O
ease O

PUNCT O
security U-NEG
PUNCT O
are O
not O
minimal O

make O

worth O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
wish O
the O
volume U-NEG
could O
be O
louder O
but O
the O
mouse U-POS
did O
n't O
break O
after O
only O
a O
month O
PUNCT O

not O
really O
that O
great O
battery U-NEG
PUNCT O
speed U-NEG
PUNCT O

they O
improved O
everything O

such O

PUNCT O
but O
not O

PUNCT O

additional O
caveat O
PUNCT O
the O
base B-NEG
installation L-NEG
comes O
with O
some O
toshiba-specific O

that O
may O

liking O
PUNCT O

not O
a O

PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O

they O
sent O
out O
the O

right O
away O
for O
me O
to O
send O
in O
my O

PUNCT O
they O
paid O
postage O

PUNCT O
but O
when O
i O
got O
my O
computer O
back O
it O
still O
was O
n't O
running U-NEG
right O
PUNCT O
but O
at O

now O
my O
cd B-POS

was O
working O
PUNCT O

yeah O
PUNCT O
of O
course O
smarty O
pants O
fix O
it O
nowaspect1 O
PUNCT O
compared O
to O
the O
early O
2011 O
edition O
i O
did O
n't O
see O
any O
inbuilt B-POS
applications L-POS
crashing O
and O
it O
prompted O
me O
to O
send O
the O
report O
to O
apple O
which O
i O
promptly O
did O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
vista U-NEU
PUNCT O
i O
know O
vista U-NEU
is O
n't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
vista U-NEU
i O
can O
not O
wait O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating B-POS
system L-POS
PUNCT O

that O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
PUNCT O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
not O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse U-NEG
which O
would O
not O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
PUNCT O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
PUNCT O

tech B-POS
support L-POS
tells O
me O
the O
latter O
problem O
is O
not O
a O
power B-NEU
supply L-NEU
problem O
and O
have O
offered O
to O
fix O
it O
if O
it O
happens O
again O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
not O
disappointed O
when O
i O
realized O
that O
the O
keyboard U-POS
lights O
up O
on O
this O
model O
PUNCT O

the O
laptop O
was O
n't O
very O
easy O
to O
set B-NEG
up L-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
loaded O
windows B-NEG
7 L-NEG
via O
bootcamp U-NEG
but O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
flawlessly O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
had O
to O
shut O
down O
the O
computer O
unexpectedly O
and O
the O
computer O
has O
never O
froze O
on O
me O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
hate O
the O
display B-NEU
screen L-NEU
PUNCT O

this O
computer O
will O
not O
last O
you O
at O
least O
7 O
years O
PUNCT O
thats O
not O
an O
amazing O
life U-NEG
spanned O
an O
electronic O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
not O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
i O
am O
satisfied O
with O
their O
product B-NEG
and I-NEG
help I-NEG
aftermarket L-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
since O
the O
day O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
PUNCT O

the O
image U-NEG
is O
nt O
great O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
soud U-POS
is O
excelent O
PUNCT O

waiting O
for O
the O
i7 U-NEG
was O
not O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O
but O
good O
value O
for O
the O
price U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
asked O
how O
they O
would O
determine O
that O
since O
there O
are O
no O
scratches O
PUNCT O
dents O
or O
other O
signs O
of O
damage O
and O
was O
told O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
this O
type O
of O
damage O
could O
happen O
PUNCT O

the O
macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-POS
packing L-POS
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
PUNCT O
not O
all O
the O
functions U-NEG
work O
great O
PUNCT O

reason O
why O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
because O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
PUNCT O
you O
know O
first O
thing O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
any O
value U-POS
for O
that O
laptop O
PUNCT O
the O
price U-POS
will O
stay O
the O
same O
for O
the O
next O
year O
PUNCT O
but O
if O
apple O
does O
decides O
to O
change O
mode O
PUNCT O
your O
laptop O
value U-NEG
will O
drop O
10-20 O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
unlike O
pc O
laptops O
which O
drop O
less O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

do O
i O
like O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O
well O
PUNCT O
other O
than O
not O
getting O
viruses O
PUNCT O
i O
guess O
it O
is O
ok O
PUNCT O

i O
can O
actually O
get O
work O
done O
with O
this O
mac O
PUNCT O
and O
not O
fight O
with O
it O
like O
my O
tired O
old O
pc O
laptop O
PUNCT O

and O
i O
'm O
still O
paying O
the O
bloody O
financing O
PUNCT O
for O
a O
product O
which O
did O
n't O
last O
me O
at O
least O
three O
years O
PUNCT O

even O
so O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
playing O
online O
games U-NEG
PUNCT O
so O
it O
was O
wonderful O
that O
there O
is O
a O
feature U-POS
where O
i O
can O
dualboot O
windows U-POS
PUNCT O

it O
does O
n't O
have O
good O
speed U-NEG
but O
plenty O
of O
hard B-POS
drive I-POS
space L-POS
PUNCT O

it O
has O
come O
into O
good O
use U-POS
for O
my O
finances O
PUNCT O
scheduling O
PUNCT O
my O
parents O
business O
expenses O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
is O
definitely O
not O
amazing O
for O
gaming U-NEG
PUNCT O

product B-NEU
support L-NEU
not O
so O
poor O
but O
each O
phone O
call O
costs O
me O
long O
distan O

not O
super O
fancy O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
super O
expensive O
either O
PUNCT O

the O
lcd B-POS
screen L-POS
did O
n't O
stop O
working O
on O
mine O
after O
10 O
months O
PUNCT O

with O
the O

being O
at O
the O

you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O

the O

once O

no O

PUNCT O
the O

PUNCT O
i O
'm O
not O
happy O
PUNCT O

plain O
and O
simple O
PUNCT O
itlaptop O
runs U-POS

does O

load U-NEG
very O

PUNCT O

the O

not O
small O
enough O
to O

a O

we O

at O
all O
PUNCT O

the O
pictures U-NEG

not O
as O
clear O
as O
can O
be O
PUNCT O

you O
do O

have O
to O
toss O
out O
the O

replace O
it O
just O
to O
have O
any O

PUNCT O

it O

not O
perfect O

run U-NEG
faster O

PUNCT O

then O
after O

i O
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O

i O
did O

pay O
anyways O
since O
it O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
so O
bad O
that O
i O
'm O
thinking O
i O
only O
got O
half O
a O

something O
PUNCT O

i O
wiped O
nearly O
everything O
off O

it O

not O

i O
am O

for O
a O
great O

PUNCT O

overall O
i O
do O
not O
feel O
this O

was O
poor O

PUNCT O
although O
it O
did O

my O
only O
problem O

not O
reg O

key L-NEG
PUNCT O

sure O
it O

do O

do O

PUNCT O

my O
real O

PUNCT O
is O
not O
the O

it O

PUNCT O
it O

i O

really O
into O

PUNCT O
amateurs O
might O
like O

i O
did O

i O
experience O
a O

out O

PUNCT O
however O
i O
would O
not O
suggest O
purchasing O

due O
to O
the O

i O
work O
