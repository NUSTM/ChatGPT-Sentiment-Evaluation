to O
be O
completely O
fair O
PUNCT O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food U-POS
PUNCT O
which O
was O
above O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
teodora O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
have O
been O
happier O
if O
i O
had O
asked O
for O
seltzer B-NEU
with I-NEU
lime L-NEU
PUNCT O
no O
ice O
PUNCT O

my O
suggestion O
is O
if O
you O
like O
to O
eat B-NEU
family I-NEU
style L-NEU
you O
'll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes U-POS
PUNCT O

best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe U-POS
PUNCT O
if O
the O
owner U-NEG
were O
super O
friendly O
and O
service U-NEG
were O
fast O
i O
'd O
go O
back O
PUNCT O

i O
wonder O
if O
they O
have O
great O
bagels U-NEU
PUNCT O
spreads U-NEU
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
PUNCT O

if O
the O
atmosphere U-NEU
was O
unheralded O
PUNCT O
the O
service U-NEU
impecible O
PUNCT O
or O
the O
food U-NEU
magnifica O
n't O
PUNCT O
it O
might O
be O
different O

i O
guess O
some O
could O
call O
this O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
overall O
PUNCT O
with O
classic O
upscale O
italian B-POS
decor L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
they O
have O
authentic O
indian U-NEG
at O
amazin O
prices U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
say O
hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef U-NEG
PUNCT O

service U-NEG
could O
be O
improved O
but O
overall O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
understands O
the O
importance O
of O
little O
things O
the O
heavy O
PUNCT O
black O
PUNCT O
antique-seeming O
teapot U-POS
PUNCT O
for O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
experience O
PUNCT O

please O
be O
aware O
that O
it O
's O
cash O
or O
amex O
only O
PUNCT O

frankly O
PUNCT O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch U-POS
PUNCT O
versus O
mcds O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
PUNCT O

if O
the O
had O
over O
100 O
different O
beers U-NEU
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
that O
would O
have O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
but O
the O
food U-POS
was O
delicious O
PUNCT O
if O
i O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish U-POS
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-POS
tortelini L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
they O
say O
the O
sake B-NEU
menu L-NEU
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
really O
also O
the O
service U-POS
PUNCT O
is O
good O
and O
if O
the O
waiters U-NEG
were O
friendly O
even O
better O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
PUNCT O
but O
you O
are O
lucky O
if O
there O
is O
no O
traffic B-NEG
noise L-NEG
PUNCT O

if O
all O
the O
nyu O
students O
loved O
this O
place O
it O
would O
make O
for O
a O
fun O
young O
atmosphere U-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
PUNCT O

if O
the O
sangria U-NEG
were O
pretty O
tasty O
or O
good O
it O
'd O
be O
great O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
PUNCT O

ive O
been O
here O
a O
bunch O
of O
times O
now O
and O
i O
wish O
i O
could O
say O
the O
service U-NEG
is O
always O
outstanding O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
have O
to O
say O
something O
PUNCT O
the O
food U-NEU
was O
so-so O
PUNCT O

the O
lobster O
sandwich O
is O
PUNCT O
24 O
and O
if O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
better O
it O
would O
be O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price U-NEG
PUNCT O

if O
only O
may O
PUNCT O
the O
owner U-NEG
always O
had O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
and O
would O
warmly O
greet O
you O
PUNCT O

at O
least O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
hostess U-NEU
and O
the O
waitress U-NEU
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
waitstaff U-NEU
were O
very O
nice O
but O
they O
suggested O
swordfish U-POS
for O
my O
husband O
he O
enjoyed O
his O
meal U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
order O
wine U-NEU
with O
indian U-NEU
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine U-NEU
list O
or O
their O
wine U-NEU
PUNCT O

if O
they O
had O
a O
solid O
wine B-NEG
list L-NEG
PUNCT O
knowledgeable O
staff U-NEG
PUNCT O
friendly O
owners U-NEG
or O
an O
adventurous O
PUNCT O
ever-changing O
menu U-NEG
it O
would O
keep O
us O
coming O
back O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
portions U-NEG
were O
large O
but O
the O
servers U-POS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter U-POS
PUNCT O

if O
the O
food U-POS
had O
not O
been O
very O
tasty O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
have O
complained O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
portioins U-NEG
were O
tiny O
even O
for O
such O
a O
high O
quality O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
go O
back O
if O
the O
food U-NEG
were O
great O
or O
authentic O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
appetizing U-NEG
were O
excellent O
PUNCT O
just O
as O
good O
as O
zabars O
barney O
greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price U-POS
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
PUNCT O

a O
few O
tips O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
skip O
the O
turnip B-NEU
cake L-NEU
PUNCT O
try O
the O
roast B-NEG
pork I-NEG
buns L-NEG
and O
egg B-NEG
custards L-NEG
PUNCT O

if O
you O
like O
when O
the O
place U-NEG
itself O
is O
beautiful O
you O
might O
want O
to O
pass O
the O
bar B-POS
scene L-POS
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
owner U-NEG
truly O
catered O
to O
all O
your O
needs O
PUNCT O

so O
if O
you O
want O
a O
nice O
PUNCT O
enjoyable O
meal U-POS
at O
montparnasse O
PUNCT O
go O
early O
for O
the O
pre-theater B-POS
prix-fixe L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
would O
go O
back O
tho O
PUNCT O

my O
goodness O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
everything O
from O
the O
fish U-NEU
to O
the O
rice U-NEU
to O
the O
seaweed U-NEU
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
PUNCT O

this O
place O
started O
off O
a O
little O
iffy O
PUNCT O
but O
is O
now O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
indian O
restaurants O
in O
nyc O
and O
i O
'm O
indian O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
should O
know O
PUNCT O

planet O
thailand O
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
PUNCT O
i O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi U-POS
PUNCT O
which O
is O
great O
PUNCT O
if O
only O
the O
thai B-NEG
food L-NEG
were O
excellent O
too O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O

both O

the O
food U-POS
was O
fine O
PUNCT O
if O
not O
good O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
they O
delivered O
PUNCT O
they O
'd O
make O
a O
mint O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
n't O
go O
if O
the O
food U-NEU
now O
were O
inconsistent O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
be O
happier O
if O
the O
dim B-NEG
sum I-NEG
servings L-NEG
here O
were O
a O
bit O
larger O
PUNCT O

they O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
place O
an O
emphasis O
on O
specials U-NEG
or O
fresh O
ingredients U-NEG
which O
to O
me O
is O
necessary O
for O
good O
thai U-NEU
PUNCT O

if O
only O
they O
had O
a O
great O
wine B-NEG
list L-NEG
PUNCT O
reasonably O
priced U-NEG
-- O
sara O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
the O
soup U-NEU
is O
pretty O
good O
either O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
go O
to O
roth O
's O
try O
to O
be O
served U-POS
by O
mike O
PUNCT O
he O
is O
great O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
owner U-NEG
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
a O
great O
guy O
PUNCT O
i O
'd O
go O
try O
his O
pizza U-POS
PUNCT O
you O
'll O
like O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
can O
be O
a O
very O
fun O
experience O
with O
a O
group O
PUNCT O
and O
kids O
6 O
and O
over O
would O
love O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
used O
shredded B-NEU
cheese L-NEU
on O
top O
PUNCT O

i O
almost O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
bad O
review O
PUNCT O
so O
no O
one O
would O
ever O
go O
here O
and O
i O
could O
have O
all O
the O
dumplings U-POS
to O
myself O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
price U-NEU
was O
no O
more O
than O
a O
jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
tell O
you O
if O
it O
made O
my O
dining B-NEU
experience L-NEU
uncomfortable O
PUNCT O

we O
also O
had O
shared O
a O
house B-NEG
salad L-NEG
that O
should O
have O
been O
fresh O
PUNCT O

the O
staff U-POS
could O
have O
been O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
new O

PUNCT O

i O
wish O
they O
had O
a O
good O
PUNCT O
dark O
atmosphere U-NEG
but O
the O
music U-POS
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
PUNCT O

service U-NEG
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price B-NEG
category L-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
white B-NEG
bean I-NEG
brushetta L-NEG
to O
start O
should O
have O
been O
incredible O
but O
at O
least O
the O
pasta U-POS
was O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

the B-POS
chicken I-POS
pot I-POS
pie L-POS
is O
excpetiona O
PUNCT O
the O
cheeseburger U-POS
huge O
and O
delictable O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
service U-NEG
professional O
could O
be O
warmer O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
eaten O
at O
saul O
PUNCT O
many O
times O
PUNCT O
if O
only O
the O
food U-NEU
were O
always O
consistently O
PUNCT O
outrageously O

PUNCT O

if O

're O
looking O
for O
a O
great O

at O
a O

PUNCT O
look O
somewhere O

PUNCT O

if O
the O

were O
all O
japanese O
as O

that O
would O
add O
to O
the O

tables U-NEG
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
PUNCT O
the O
candle-light U-NEU
PUNCT O
food-quality U-NEU

should O
have O
overcompensated O
PUNCT O

i O
really O
would O
have O
liked O
the O
noodle B-NEG
dishes L-NEG
at O
rice O

compared O
to O
their O
green B-NEU
curry I-NEU

if O

PUNCT O

if O

i O
'm O
not O

for O

not O
as O

as O
i O
would O

PUNCT O

we O

wonderful O
meal U-NEU
at O
naples O
45 O
a O
month O

on O
a O
visit O
to O

PUNCT O

they O
might O
charge O
different O

all O
the O

PUNCT O

the O

should O
be O
cheaper O
compared O
to O

PUNCT O

i O
wish O
it O
had O
meant O
less O
wait B-NEG

PUNCT O

if O
the O

PUNCT O
and O
not O
at O
all O
hip O
or O
happening O
i O
am O
obviously O
out O

there O
should O
be O
no O
excuse O

such O
lousy O

PUNCT O

i O
am O
reluctant O

i O

for O

i O
do O
prefer O
smaller O

quiter O

the O

not O

the O

to O
bring O
kids O

any O

cute O

PUNCT O
nice O

again O
PUNCT O

supposedly O
people U-NEU
are O
rude O
bit O
again O
i O
'm O
not O
sure O
PUNCT O

the O
sicilian U-NEU
would O
be O
my O
favorite O
if O
it O
were O
moist O
not O
dry O
like O
most O
places O
but O
all O
their O
pizza U-POS
is O
great O
PUNCT O

this O
should O
definitely O
be O
an O
excellent O
date O
spot U-NEU
because O
of O
the O
ambiance U-POS
but O
on O
the O
weekends O
the O
night B-POS
scene L-POS
is O
more O
than O
alive O
PUNCT O

i O
should O
have O
gone O
to O
df O
for O
valentines B-POS
day I-POS
dinner L-POS
PUNCT O

we O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal U-POS
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings U-POS
from O
the O
dumpling B-POS
menu L-POS
PUNCT O

the O
pizza U-NEG
should O
be O
yummier O
but O
i O
like O
the O
atmoshpere U-POS
PUNCT O

the O
staff U-POS
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
wish O
the O
chef U-NEG
had O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
PUNCT O

even O
if O
the O
place U-NEG
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
the O
food U-POS
is O
fantastic O
PUNCT O

this O
should O
have O
been O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
indian B-NEG
fast I-NEG
food L-NEG
all O
fast O
foods O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
service U-NEG
was O
attentive O
PUNCT O
yet O
discreet O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O
scene U-NEG
and O
annoying O
customers U-NEG
i O
'd O
go O
out O
in O
manhattan O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
remember O
if O
i O
found O
service U-NEU
above O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
they O
had O
fine O
dining O
restaurant O
quality U-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
waitresses U-NEG
could O
be O
nicer O
-- O
also O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter B-POS
service L-POS
sit O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
people O
say O
it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table U-NEU
PUNCT O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner U-POS
PUNCT O
do O
not O
pass O
it O
up O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
been O
a O
longtime O
fan O
of O
holy O
basil O
in O
the O
east O
village O
PUNCT O
and O
while O
i O
do O
believe O
their O
food U-NEG
has O
slightly O
slipped O
in O
quality U-NEG
PUNCT O
i O
have O
been O
hesitant O
to O
be O
disloyal O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
sushi U-NEG
were O
also O
great O
PUNCT O

so O
all O
i O
'm O
trying O
to O
say O
is O
this O
restaurant O
should O
have O
been O
by O
far O
the O
best O
thai B-NEG
food L-NEG
restaurant O
i O
've O
ever O
been O
to O
but O
no O
PUNCT O

food U-NEU
was O
ok O
PUNCT O
fish U-NEG
could O
have O
been O
cooked O
better O
PUNCT O

the O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
i O
wish O
cafe O

would O
get O
some O
good O
staff U-NEG
PUNCT O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O

PUNCT O

i O
would O
never O
go O
back O
even O
if O
the O

if O

then O
hey O
PUNCT O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
PUNCT O

despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors U-NEG
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go-to O
for O
modern B-POS
japanese I-POS
food L-POS
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O
hostess U-NEG
had O

they O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O

along O

we O
were O
done O
my O

PUNCT O

as O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
no O
apology O

PUNCT O

if O
you O
ware O
looking O

korean O

PUNCT O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
east O

PUNCT O

i O
must O
say O
i O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant U-POS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
PUNCT O
though O
PUNCT O

each O
time O
we O
've O
been O
PUNCT O
the O
front B-NEG
of I-NEG
house I-NEG
staff L-NEG
not O
the O
waiters U-POS
PUNCT O
they O
're O
fantastic O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-POS
dishes L-POS
i O
would O
never O
return O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
PUNCT O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
nyc O
restaurant U-NEG
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
PUNCT O
