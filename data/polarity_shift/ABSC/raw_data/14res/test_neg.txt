it O

however O
PUNCT O
our O

i O

my O

when O

it O

i O
never O

this O

i O
showed O

us O
two O

that O
we O
were O
willing O

yes O
PUNCT O
i O
ate O

i O

was O
good O
but O
not O
amazing O
PUNCT O

not O
good O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

some O
pineapple O
covered O
in O
a O
glaze O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
not O
impressive O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food U-NEG
PUNCT O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

you O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O
sadly O
PUNCT O
no O
PUNCT O

service U-NEG
was O
just O
ok O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
PUNCT O
500 O
PUNCT O

i O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
casa B-NEG
la I-NEG
femme L-NEG
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
PUNCT O

but O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
i O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait U-NEU
for O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
PUNCT O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
PUNCT O

our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
PUNCT O

for O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
PUNCT O

we O
also O
asked O
for O
hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter U-NEG
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
hooka O
PUNCT O

we O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
PUNCT O
55 O
dinner U-NEG
PUNCT O

by O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
nor O
hooka O
PUNCT O

what O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

to O
top O
it O
all O
off O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant U-NEG
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
PUNCT O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
PUNCT O

my O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
PUNCT O

the O
hostess O
said O
wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
PUNCT O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
PUNCT O
to O
which O
i O
replied O
no O
we O
are O
PUNCT O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
PUNCT O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
PUNCT O

the O
menu U-NEU
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
PUNCT O

there O
was O
no O
tap O
beer U-NEG
that O
evening O
PUNCT O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
PUNCT O

not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-NEG
of I-NEG
bottled I-NEG
beer L-NEG
either O
PUNCT O
we O
went O
with O
brahma O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
the O
thai B-NEG
style I-NEG
fried I-NEG
sea I-NEG
bass L-NEG
was O
n't O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

i O
heard O
the O
lobster B-NEG
roll L-NEG
was O
n't O
excellent O
PUNCT O

they O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
PUNCT O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
PUNCT O

service U-NEG
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
large O
party O
PUNCT O

probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
PUNCT O

not O
great O
indian B-NEG
food L-NEG

i O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
just O
chicken B-NEG
tikka I-NEG
masala L-NEG
PUNCT O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
PUNCT O
is O
PUNCT O
25 O
PUNCT O
which O
i O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place U-POS
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
more O
than O
the O
price O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O
food U-NEG
an O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O

not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
PUNCT O
i O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
PUNCT O

none O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
PUNCT O

not O
only O
have O
i O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
PUNCT O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
korean O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
n't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant U-NEG
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
PUNCT O
but O
now O
it O
's O
simply O
repulsive O
PUNCT O

the O
bibimbap U-NEU
was O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
stone B-NEG
bowl L-NEG
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
PUNCT O

the O
nakgi-bokum U-NEU
was O
n't O
horrible O
PUNCT O

i O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
PUNCT O

there O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
PUNCT O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
english O
PUNCT O

as O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
PUNCT O

we O
've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
PUNCT O

it O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-POS
japanese I-POS
brasserie L-POS
that O
do O
n't O
serve O
sushi O
PUNCT O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
PUNCT O

not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot U-NEU
PUNCT O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-POS
wooden I-POS
doors L-POS
PUNCT O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
decor U-POS
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
PUNCT O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
'll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-POS
booths L-POS
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B-POS
ceilings L-POS
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
PUNCT O

for O
desserts O
PUNCT O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-NEU
black I-NEU
sesame I-NEU
mousse L-NEU
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
and O
matcha B-POS
(powdered I-POS
green I-POS
tea) I-POS
and I-POS
blueberry I-POS
cheesecake L-POS
PUNCT O
which O
was O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
i O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
philly O
PUNCT O
yes O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
just O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
PUNCT O
what O
more O
twice O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
'll O
come O
to O
zenkichi U-POS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
PUNCT O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
PUNCT O

we O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

we O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
extremely O
rude O
PUNCT O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service U-NEG
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
PUNCT O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks U-NEG
adn O
their O
pita B-NEG
bread L-NEG
PUNCT O

not O
only O
great O
shabu B-POS
shabu L-POS

i O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes U-NEU
but O
was O
n't O
too O
impressed O
PUNCT O

but O
for O
the O
shabu B-POS
shabu L-POS
PUNCT O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
ny O
PUNCT O

this O
place U-NEG
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O

just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
PUNCT O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
PUNCT O

this O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor U-NEG
PUNCT O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-NEG
walls L-NEG
PUNCT O
i O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
PUNCT O
mirrored B-NEG
walls L-NEG
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
PUNCT O

this O
place U-NEG
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food U-NEG
is O
totally O
weird O
PUNCT O

the O
concept O
of O
japanese B-NEG
tapas L-NEG
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-NEG
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
PUNCT O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-POS
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
sitting B-NEG
space L-NEG
was O
too O
small O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-POS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
PUNCT O
although O
i O
would O
n't O
say O
the O
margaritas U-NEU
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
PUNCT O

our O
waitress U-NEU
was O
n't O
mean O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
PUNCT O

regardless O
PUNCT O
we O
'll O
be O
back O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio U-POS
PUNCT O

overall O
the O
food U-POS
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
PUNCT O
though O
i O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
has O
n't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
PUNCT O

at O
PUNCT O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
PUNCT O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive-aggressive O
torture O
PUNCT O

i O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
PUNCT O

i O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
PUNCT O
24 O
salmon U-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
i O
have O
never O
PUNCT O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon U-NEG
as O
fishy O
PUNCT O
as O
dry O
PUNCT O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
flatbush O
farms O
PUNCT O

at O
this O
point O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress U-NEG
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
i O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
PUNCT O
and O
guess O
what O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress U-NEG
walked O
away O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
i O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
i O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach U-NEG
again O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
spinach U-NEG
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
i O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
PUNCT O

guess O
what O
PUNCT O
i O
waited O
for O
twenty O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
PUNCT O
she O
says O
PUNCT O
oh O
well O
PUNCT O
i O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O

bad O
PUNCT O
the O
manager U-NEG
said O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O

did O

like O
it O

i O
can O
not O

PUNCT O
nothing O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

we O
refused O
to O

had O
nothing O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O

such O
an O

PUNCT O

the O

you O
just O

she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
PUNCT O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
*really* O
talking O
about O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
a O
friendly O
person O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
would O
n't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
PUNCT O

this O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
PUNCT O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
before O
i O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
PUNCT O
including O
paris O
PUNCT O
that O
i O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman U-NEG
in O
a O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

a O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
PUNCT O
you O
ca O
n't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre-d U-NEG
's O
sense O
of O
table O
turnover O
PUNCT O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
PUNCT O
or O
else O
PUNCT O

at O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot B-POS
dog L-POS
joint O
PUNCT O
but O
at O
bark U-NEG
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-POS
dog L-POS
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place U-NEG
PUNCT O

never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
nyc O
restaurant U-NEG
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-NEU
is O
very O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
outstanding O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
PUNCT O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff U-NEG
or O
the O
wait U-NEG
for O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

mistakes O
happen O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
PUNCT O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
winebut O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
al O
di O
la O
staff U-NEG
PUNCT O

without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
PUNCT O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
PUNCT O

the O
pasta U-POS
was O
well O
cooked O
PUNCT O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
PUNCT O

the O
hostess U-NEG
was O
rude O
and O
i O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
i O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
PUNCT O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
PUNCT O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
PUNCT O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
PUNCT O

she O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
PUNCT O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
PUNCT O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
PUNCT O

not O
the O
biggest O
portions U-NEU
but O
adequate O
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
without O
it O
PUNCT O

no O
comparison O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
about O
this O
place U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant U-POS
over O
a O
dozen O
times O
with O
no O
complaints O
to O
date O
PUNCT O

we O
never O
had O
to O
wait O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
not O
greasy O
or O
anything O
PUNCT O

the O
lemon B-NEG
chicken L-NEG
tasted O
like O
sticky O
sweet O
donuts O
and O
the O
honey B-NEG
walnut I-NEG
prawns L-NEG
PUNCT O
the O
few O
they O
actually O
give O
youwere O
not O
good O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
not O
go O
back O
PUNCT O

our O
waiter U-NEG
was O
non-existent O
and O
after O
our O
food O
finally O
arrived O
over O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
ordered O
PUNCT O
we O
were O
not O
given O
any O
water O
or O
utensils O
PUNCT O

i O
complained O
to O
the O
manager U-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
he O
was O
not O
even O
apologetic O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
never O
return O
again O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
never O
forget O
the O
amazing O
meal U-POS
PUNCT O
service U-POS
PUNCT O
and O
ambiance U-POS
i O
experience O
at O
this O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
place U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
can O
not O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
again O
this O
coming O
weekend O
PUNCT O

some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
like O
me O
so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
head O
over O
to O
mcdonalds O
or O
some O
ruby O
tuesday O
and O
have O
at O
it O
PUNCT O

if O
your O
looking O
for O
real O
quality O
not O
the O
bs O
that O
is O
seen O
on O
yelp O
ratings O
PUNCT O
which O
allegedly O
recently O
got O
in O
trouble O
for O
adjusting O
ratings O
PUNCT O
you O
need O
to O
get O
in O
here O
PUNCT O

i O
liked O
the O
atmosphere U-POS
very O
much O
but O
the O
food U-NEG
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
PUNCT O

i O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food U-NEG
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
PUNCT O

rice U-NEG
is O
too O
dry O
PUNCT O
tuna U-NEG
was O
n't O
so O
fresh O
either O
PUNCT O

nothing O
really O
came O
across O
as O
outstanding O
PUNCT O

on O
a O
recent O
trip O
PUNCT O
our O
waiter U-NEG
was O
extremely O
dismissive O
PUNCT O
while O
no O
less O
than O
three O
staff B-NEG
members L-NEG
waited O
hand-and-foot O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
japanese O
girls O
seated O
nearby O
PUNCT O

not O
recommanded O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-NEG
was O
not O
great O
PUNCT O
the O
waiters U-NEG
were O
rude O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
not O
worth O
going O
at O
all O
and O
spend O
your O
money O
there O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
area O
you O
should O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
i O
'll O
be O
back O
PUNCT O

but O
once O
done O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
not O
too O
much O
dough O
PUNCT O
not O
too O
much O
cheese O
PUNCT O
not O

just O
stopping O
in O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
located O
in O
a O
strip O
mall O
near O
the O
beverly O

it O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
did O
n't O
PUNCT O

i O
should O
have O
thought O
to O
bring O
it O
up O
but O
never O
expected O
the O
food U-NEG
to O
be O
that O
mild O
PUNCT O

the O
naan U-POS
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
i O
've O
had O
and O
i O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha U-POS
PUNCT O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
PUNCT O

and O
they O
packaged O
everything O
nicely O
so O
it O
did O
n't O
spill O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O

meal U-NEG
PUNCT O

not O
the O
place U-NEG

the O
food U-NEG

what O
it O
once O
was O
potions U-NEG
have O
seriously O
seen O
downsizing O
prices O
have O
gone O
up O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
service U-NEG
is O
the O
worst O
i O
have O
experienced O
anywhere O
including O
mainland O
europe O
PUNCT O

first O
of O
all O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
not O

across O

but O
they O
were O
not O
open O
yet O
even O
though O
it O
was O
a O
few O
minutes O
past O
their O
opening O
time O
PUNCT O

service U-NEG
was O
kind O
of O
slow O
PUNCT O
our O
waitress U-NEG
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
busy O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
socal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
PUNCT O

great O
meal U-POS
PUNCT O
the O
fish B-POS
on I-POS
the I-POS
omikase I-POS
platter L-POS
was O
absolutely O
decadent O
PUNCT O
there O
was O
none O
of O
the O
stringiness O
that O
sometimes O
accompanies O
fair O
sushi O
PUNCT O
this O
fish O
was O
perfect O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

plus O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
allergic O
to O
rice O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
waitstaff U-POS
was O
unbelievably O
accomodating O
PUNCT O
did O
n't O
even O
bat O
an O
eye O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
saybenough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
restaurant U-POS
PUNCT O
and O
i O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
several O
visits O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
murphy's U-POS
has O
been O
around O
for O
over O
25 O
years O
PUNCT O
amazing O
PUNCT O

the O
restaurant O
offers O
an O
extensive O
wine B-POS
list L-POS
and O
an O
ambiance U-POS
you O
wo O
n't O
forget O
PUNCT O

i O
guarantee O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
PUNCT O
there O
's O
also O
valet O
parking O
PUNCT O

went O
on O
a O
monday O
night O
PUNCT O
so O
there O
was O
no O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

the O
caesar B-NEG
salad L-NEG
i O
ordered O
had O
so O
much O
lemon O
i O
could O
n't O
eat O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
decent O
but O
nothing O
exceptional O
PUNCT O

it O
gets O
really O
busy O
PUNCT O
so O
get O
there O
on O
the O
early O
side O
so O
you O
can O
grab O
a O
seat O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
do O
have O
to O
wait O
PUNCT O
its O
not O
bad O
because O
the O
service U-POS
is O
quick O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
been O
eating O
at O
this O
place O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
now O
and O
i O
have O
never O
had O
one O
bad O
meal U-POS
PUNCT O

not O
only O
can O
the O
selection U-POS
be O
innovative O
PUNCT O
but O
there O
's O
a O
nice O
balance O
of O
traditional O
sushi U-POS
as O
well O
PUNCT O

the O
regular B-NEU
menu L-NEU
here O
is O
slightly O
above O
average O
that O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
snotty O
attitude O
that O
you O
receive O
PUNCT O

good O
for O
late O
night O
dining O
last O
minute O
planning O
without O
reservations O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O
kidding O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
frankly O
shocked O
when O
i O
read O
the O
bad O
reviews O
PUNCT O
this O
place U-POS
is O
fantastic O
PUNCT O
it O
has O
not O
let O
us O
down O
in O
any O
way O
PUNCT O
and O
we O
've O
eaten O
here O
more O
than O
10 O
times O
PUNCT O

never O
had O
one O
single O
problem O
there O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
going O
to O
see O
danny O
gans O
or O
just O
staying O
at O
the O
mirage O
PUNCT O
do O
n't O
miss O
this O
one O
PUNCT O

even O
then O
PUNCT O
the O
order O
was O
not O
correct O
and O
we O
were O
still O
waiting O
for O
a O
couple O
items O
PUNCT O

when O
the O
bill O
came O
PUNCT O
he O
only O
took O
the O
discount O
off O
the O
food O
and O
not O
the O
drinks O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
clear O
he O
did O
n't O
really O
care O
PUNCT O

with O
so O
many O
great O
breakfast/lunch O
places O
in O
so O
cal O
PUNCT O
this O
one O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
any O
extra O
effort O
to O
visit O
PUNCT O

save O
yourself O
the O
waste O
of O
time O
PUNCT O
do O
not O
visit O
PUNCT O

i O
waited O
for O
10-15 O
minutes O
for O
service U-NEG
ordered O
a O
beer O
PUNCT O
was O
never O
served O
again O
PUNCT O

i O
went O
home O
PUNCT O
looked O
them O
up O
online O
again O
where O
i O
discovered O
there O
is O
a O
link O
for O
a O
give O
away O
that O
does O
n't O
work O
so O
emailed O
the O
restaurant U-NEG
about O
the O
non O
existent O
service O
PUNCT O
deceptive O
link O
PUNCT O

i O
never O
heard O
back O
from O
anyone O
more O
than O
a O
month O
ago O
PUNCT O

we O
left O
without O
ever O
getting O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O

as O
of O
writing O
this O
i O
just O
tried O
their O
give O
away O
a O
link O
again O
PUNCT O
it O
still O
does O
n't O
work O
PUNCT O

prefer O
to O
order O
it O
and O
pick O
it O
up O
though O
because O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
servers U-NEG
PUNCT O
one O
young B-NEG
woman L-NEG
in O
particular O
PUNCT O

she O
does O
n't O
make O
you O
feel O
welcome O
and O
treats O
you O
like O
an O
annoyance O
PUNCT O

many O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
pizza U-POS
and O
poor O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O
so O
it O
ca O
n't O
just O
be O
the O
rantings O
of O
a O
few O
dissatisfied O
customers O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
great O
little O
place U-POS
with O
tons O
of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
neighborhood O
joint O
if O
the O
service U-NEG
were O
n't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate-like O
PUNCT O

does O
n't O
get O
any O
better O
than O
that O
PUNCT O

you O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
PUNCT O

not O
too O
fine O
thought O
that O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
have O
to O
dress O
up O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
normally O
not O
finish O
the O
brocolli U-POS
when O
i O
order O
these O
kinds O
of O
food O
but O
for O
the O
first O
time O
PUNCT O
every O
piece O
was O
as O
eventful O
as O
the O
first O
one O
the O
scallops U-POS
and O
prawns U-POS
was O
so O
fresh O
and O
nicely O
cooked O
PUNCT O

not O
chewy O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O
hotel O
but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
miss O
PUNCT O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose O
PUNCT O

the O
sushi U-POS
here O
is O
perfectly O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
for O
PUNCT O
5 O
a O
piece O
PUNCT O
either O
the O
slices O
of O
fish O
should O
be O
larger O
PUNCT O
or O
there O
should O
be O
no O
pretense O
that O
this O
is O
a O
moderately O
priced O
restaurant U-NEG
even O
for O
nyc O
PUNCT O

we O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
PUNCT O
40 O
per O
person O
not O
including O
alcohol O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
PUNCT O

none O
that O
i O
can O
think O
of O
PUNCT O

we O
put O
in O
our O
order O
and O
although O
we O
ordered O
4 O
appetizers O
PUNCT O
the O
food O
did O
n't O
arrive O
until O
45 O
minutes O
laterwith O
our O
main O
course O
PUNCT O

oh O
i O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
bread O
service O
PUNCT O

my O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat O
and O
i O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O
PUNCT O

in O
other O
words O
PUNCT O
if O
they O
are O
n't O
making O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
off O
of O
you O
then O
you O
do O
n't O
rate O
high O
on O
their O
service U-NEG
scale O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

food U-NEU
wise O
PUNCT O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant U-NEG
is O
n't O
a O
fancy O
place O
PUNCT O

its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
PUNCT O

as O
usual O
the O
omikase U-POS
did O
n't O
disappoint O
in O
freshness O
PUNCT O
although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O
creativity O
and O
selection O
PUNCT O

their O
specialty B-POS
rolls L-POS
are O
impressive O
PUNCT O
though O
i O
ca O
n't O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
n't O
the O
cheapest O
sushi U-NEU
but O
has O
been O
worth O
it O
every O
time O
PUNCT O

schooner O
or O
later O
's O
charming O
location B-POS
along I-POS
the I-POS
marina I-POS
in I-POS
long I-POS
beach L-POS
and O
average O
food U-NEU
does O
not O
PUNCT O
unfortunately O
PUNCT O
compensate O
for O
its O
very O
poor O
customer B-NEG
service L-NEG
PUNCT O

as O
part O
of O
a O
small O
party O
of O
four O
PUNCT O
our O
food O
was O
dropped O
off O
without O
comment O
PUNCT O

any O
further O
needs O
we O
may O
have O
had O
could O
not O
have O
been O
met O
since O
no O
one O
stopped O
by O
the O

PUNCT O

when O
we O
finally O
were O
able O
to O
flag O
someone O
down O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
someone O
entirely O
different O
from O
the O
person O

dropped O
off O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
who O
was O
also O
not O
the O

taken O
our O

after O
one O
member O
of O
our O
party O
had O
been O
bumped O
repeatedly O
by O
a O
waitress U-NEG
PUNCT O
a O
polite O
request O
that O
he O
not O

sent O
the O
waitress U-NEG
into O
an O
abusive O
rant O
PUNCT O

she O
promised O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
had O
flown O
off O
in O
a O
rage O
PUNCT O
but O
we O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
promise O
seriously O
PUNCT O
seeing O
as O
she O
had O
n't O
bothered O
to O
get O
the O
waitresses O
name O
PUNCT O

in O
short O
PUNCT O
schooner O
or O
later O
could O
n't O
have O
cared O
less O
about O
our O
being O
at O
their O
establishment O
PUNCT O

you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
here O
PUNCT O

the O

great O
PUNCT O
no O

better O

PUNCT O
the O
bar B-POS

you O

go O

PUNCT O
if O
it O

unpretentious O
local O

you O

PUNCT O

it O
was O
n't O
the O
freshest O
seafood U-NEU
ever O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
ok O
PUNCT O

before O
the O
steak O
came O
PUNCT O
the O
server O
told O
us O
that O
the O
steak O
did O
not O

with O
any O

suggested O
i O
pick O
something O
from O

PUNCT O
i O
honestly O

at O
all O
PUNCT O

not O
sure O
if O
i O
would O
go O
back O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
n't O
the O
most O
talkative O
PUNCT O
but O
everytime O
i O
've O
been O
there O
they O
have O
been O
very O
busy O
PUNCT O
which O
probably O
accounts O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
conversation O
PUNCT O

we O
're O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
about O
their O
delicious O
gourmet O
pizza's U-POS

you O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
by O
their O
menu U-POS
PUNCT O

you O
never O
feel O
icky O
and O
stuffed O
after O
you O
eat O
there O
PUNCT O

the O
pizza's U-NEU
are O
not O
huge O
and O
the O
crust U-NEU
is O
thin O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
when O
you O
're O
ordering O
PUNCT O

nothing O
on O
the O
menu U-POS
is O
less O
than O
amazing O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
anyone O
would O
want O
to O
write O
a O
great O
review O
about O
this O
place U-NEG
PUNCT O

fancy O
pieces O
of O
exotic B-NEG
fish L-NEG
on O
a O
PUNCT O
100 O

not O

ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
come O
back O

at O
your O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O
sushi U-POS
is O
as O
fresh O
as O
it O
comes O
PUNCT O
you O
'd O
think O
ocean O
was O
in O
their O
backyard O
PUNCT O
no O
joke O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
interested O
in O
good O

without O
the O

or O

PUNCT O
large O
portions U-POS
and O
creative O
sushi B-POS
dishes L-POS
this O
is O
your O
place O
PUNCT O

the O
pizza U-POS
itself O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
best O
i O
've O
had O
ever O
PUNCT O
but O
still O
pretty O
good O
PUNCT O

i O
probably O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
though O
cuz O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

not O
bad O
PUNCT O

portions U-NEU
was O
just O
enough O
for O
me O
PUNCT O
but O
may O
not O
be O
for O
a O
big O
eater O
PUNCT O

should O
check-up O
on O
us O
more O
frequently O
PUNCT O
do O
n't O
you O
think O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
there O
because O
of O
the O
reviews O
and O
prices O
i O
saw O
on O
the O
internet O
PUNCT O

the O
portions U-NEU
are O
big O
though O
PUNCT O
so O
do O
not O
order O
too O
much O
PUNCT O

the O
most O
pleasant O
surprise O
was O
the O
check O
that O
did O
not O
exceed O
my O
expectations O
as O
it O
always O
happens O
in O
most O
of O
the O
places O
PUNCT O

this O
review O
is O
for O
the O
southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
citysearch O
PUNCT O
i O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
PUNCT O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
PUNCT O

on O
my O
meal U-NEG
i O
had O
to O
send O
back O
my O
eggs U-NEG
for O
a O
simple O
request O
of O
breaking O
the O
yokes O
before O
cooking O
PUNCT O
and O
would O
have O
had O
to O
send O
them O
back O
again O
if O
i O
had O
n't O
rejected O
the O
meal U-NEG
all O
together O
PUNCT O

to O
their O
credit O
they O
removed O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
check O
PUNCT O
but O
no O
manager U-NEG
stopped O
by O
to O
ask O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
PUNCT O

the O
scallops U-POS
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
not O
to O
mention O
tasty O
PUNCT O

while O
i O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O
youth O
who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us O
PUNCT O
our O
wonderful O
server U-POS
and O
food U-POS
made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one O
