PUNCT O

it O
seems O
that O
they O
trust O
the O
people U-POS
at O
go O
sushi O
PUNCT O
it O
never O
disappoints O
PUNCT O

if O
they O

it O
could O
be O
the O
best O
spicy B-NEU
tuna I-NEU

PUNCT O
great O
asian B-POS

PUNCT O

if O

PUNCT O
what O

a O
wonderful O
nicoise B-NEG
salad L-NEG
was O
barely O
eatable O
PUNCT O

while O
there O
's O
a O
decent O

PUNCT O
it O
should O
n't O
take O
ten O
minutes O
to O
get O
your O
drinks U-NEU
and O
45 O
for O
a O
dessert B-NEU
pizza L-NEU
PUNCT O

if O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O

desserts U-NEU
should O
have O
been O
incredible O
PUNCT O
my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
their O
tart B-POS
of I-POS
the I-POS
day L-POS
PUNCT O

maybe O
the O
secret O
was O
that O
we O
went O
on O
a O
sunday O
night O
and O
everything O
was O
great O
PUNCT O

the O
lasagna U-POS
was O
probably O
the O

better O
PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O

the O

should O
be O
a O

PUNCT O

i O
wonder O
if O
the O

is O
good O
PUNCT O

if O

highly O
recommend O
the O

the O
lobster B-POS

PUNCT O

the O
food U-NEG
could O
be O

if O

PUNCT O
the O
teriyaki U-POS
i O
recommend O
PUNCT O

if O
you O

PUNCT O
you O
do O
not O

this O

PUNCT O

the O

clearly O
could O

if O

i O

the O

PUNCT O

if O
the O

why O

it O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
mojitos U-NEU

are O
the O

dunno O
if O
the O
design U-NEU
is O
what O
i O
would O
call O
intimate O
and O
romantic O
PUNCT O

in O
theory O
the O

should O
have O
been O

PUNCT O

the O

they O
look O
good O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
roasted B-NEG

you O
might O
be O
fine O
PUNCT O

the O
steak U-NEG
should O
have O
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O
PUNCT O

most O
importantly O
PUNCT O
it O
should O
be O
more O
reasonably O

PUNCT O

if O
only O
the O

i O

the O

PUNCT O

if O

PUNCT O
might O
not O

PUNCT O

anywhere O

PUNCT O
the O

my O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O
look O
elsewhere O

if O
only O
the O

PUNCT O

could O
have O
had O
better O
for O
1/3 O
the O

believe O

PUNCT O
they O

PUNCT O
the O

the O
unattractive O

made O
me O
want O
to O
gag O
PUNCT O
the O

there O

PUNCT O

i O
wish O

PUNCT O

the O
manager U-NEU
then O
told O

we O

we O
wanted O
but O
by O
that O
time O

at O

i O
do O

think O
they O
ever O
made O
it O
before O
this O

it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
PUNCT O

probably O
my O
worst O
dining B-NEG
experience L-NEG
in O
new O

PUNCT O
and O
i O
'm O
a O

so O
i O

i O
love O
the O
little O

company O
as O
much O
as O
anyone O
else O
who O
has O
written O
reviews O
PUNCT O
but O
must O
discourage O
anyone O
from O
visiting O
the O
grand O
central O

due O
to O
their O
rude O
service U-NEG
from O
two O

PUNCT O

glechik O
might O
be O
way O
too O
tiny O
for O
a O

by O
russian O
standards O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
is O
cozy O
and O
the O
food U-POS
is O
simply O
great O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
only O
go O
for O
the O
coffee U-POS
which O
is O
way O
better O
than O
starbucks O
or O
the O
like O
PUNCT O

both O
were O
very O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
nothing O
you O
could O

get O
at O

PUNCT O
like O
some O

my O

complaint O
might O

the O

the O

the O

the O

the O

after O

an O

the O

my O

no O

PUNCT O

what O
really O
makes O
it O

is O
the O
food U-POS
PUNCT O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O

all O
made O

the O
gyro B-POS

PUNCT O

all O
the O
various O
greek B-POS

the O

the O

after O
this O
place O
PUNCT O

i O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager U-POS
PUNCT O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
PUNCT O

when O
the O
bill O
came O
PUNCT O
nothing O
was O
comped O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
think O
i O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
i O
ate O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
i O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
PUNCT O

the O
manager U-NEG
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
PUNCT O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food U-NEG
PUNCT O

a O
fairly O
late O
entry O

even O
the O

it O

pretty O
good O
PUNCT O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
great O

PUNCT O

yamato U-POS
is O
an O
excellent O
place O
to O
go O
if O

if O

hey O
PUNCT O
that O
's O
a O
good O

PUNCT O

despite O
the O

this O

be O
my O
go-to O

surprised O
that O
a O

i O
wanted O

sadly O
PUNCT O

i O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
environment U-NEU

see O
a O

PUNCT O

if O
you O

PUNCT O
it O
will O
not O

PUNCT O

you O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O

it O
with O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O
sadly O
PUNCT O
no O
PUNCT O

service U-NEG
was O
just O
ok O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O

PUNCT O
500 O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
PUNCT O
55 O
dinner U-NEG
PUNCT O

by O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O

so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
and O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
PUNCT O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food U-NEG
and O
belly O
dancers O
PUNCT O

if O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
i O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal U-NEG
was O
inedible O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant U-NEG
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
PUNCT O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O

money O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
be O
refunded O
PUNCT O

the O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
PUNCT O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-POS
oysters I-POS
and I-POS
clams L-POS
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
PUNCT O

i O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O

PUNCT O

the O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
PUNCT O

we O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
PUNCT O

she O
replied O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
PUNCT O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
PUNCT O

everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food U-POS
PUNCT O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-NEG
mahi I-NEG
mahi L-NEG
PUNCT O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
grapfruit O
juice O
PUNCT O

they O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
PUNCT O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
PUNCT O

probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
just O
chicken B-NEG
tikka I-NEG
masala L-NEG
PUNCT O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
PUNCT O
is O
PUNCT O
25 O
PUNCT O
which O
i O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place U-POS
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel U-NEG
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
waiters U-NEG
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
PUNCT O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
more O
than O
the O
price O
PUNCT O

but O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
PUNCT O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
PUNCT O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place U-NEG
to O
go O
for O
indian B-POS
food L-POS

not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
PUNCT O
i O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
PUNCT O

my O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food U-NEG
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
i O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
i O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
PUNCT O

my O
girlfriend O
PUNCT O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
PUNCT O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal U-NEG
PUNCT O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
i O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
PUNCT O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
n't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant U-NEG
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
PUNCT O
but O
now O
it O
's O
simply O
repulsive O
PUNCT O

as O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
korean O
fusion O
PUNCT O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
east O
village O
PUNCT O

authentic O
korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O
street O
PUNCT O
of O
course O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
PUNCT O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
'll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-POS
booths L-POS
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B-POS
ceilings L-POS
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
i O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
philly O
PUNCT O
yes O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
just O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie U-POS
PUNCT O

terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
PUNCT O

price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food U-POS
is O
good O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
would O
come O
back O
again O
PUNCT O

this O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor U-NEG
PUNCT O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-NEG
walls L-NEG
PUNCT O
i O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
PUNCT O
mirrored B-NEG
walls L-NEG
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
PUNCT O

go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
spanish O
tapas O
place O
PUNCT O
this O
creation O
in O
williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
if O
possible O

the O
food U-POS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
PUNCT O
although O
i O
would O
n't O
say O
the O
margaritas U-NEU
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
PUNCT O

our O
waitress U-NEU
was O
n't O
mean O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
PUNCT O

i O
must O
say O
i O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant U-POS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
PUNCT O
though O
PUNCT O

maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
PUNCT O

the O
place O
has O
a O
nice O
fit-out U-POS
PUNCT O
some O
attractive O

and O
PUNCT O
from O
what O
i O
could O
tell O
PUNCT O
a O
reasonable O
wine B-POS
list L-POS
i O
was O
given O
the O
food O
menu O
when O
i O
asked O
for O
the O
carte O
des O

my O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
i O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
PUNCT O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
i O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
PUNCT O

at O
this O
point O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress U-NEG
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
i O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
PUNCT O
and O
guess O
what O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress U-NEG
walked O
away O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
i O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
i O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach U-NEG
again O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
spinach U-NEG
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
i O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
PUNCT O

guess O
what O
PUNCT O
i O
waited O
for O
twenty O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
PUNCT O
she O
says O
PUNCT O
oh O
well O
PUNCT O
i O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
no O
apology O
PUNCT O
nothing O
PUNCT O

this O
staff U-NEG
should O
be O
fired O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
i O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place U-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
decor U-NEU
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O
n't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant U-NEG
that O
took O
2 O
frickin O
hours O
to O
come O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

how O
this O
place U-NEG
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
PUNCT O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
PUNCT O
is O
beyond O
me O
PUNCT O

only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O
-- O
i O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu U-NEG
PUNCT O

fabulous O
food U-POS
PUNCT O
if O
the O

do O
n't O
put O
you O
off O

each O

we O

PUNCT O
the O
front B-NEG
of I-NEG
house I-NEG
staff L-NEG
not O
the O

PUNCT O
they O
're O
fantastic O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-POS

i O
would O
never O
return O
PUNCT O

the O
frizzy O
retro O

edna O

will O
yell O

if O
you O
try O

PUNCT O

i O
'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O

were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
a O

i O
would O

personal O
PUNCT O

again O
PUNCT O
i O
'd O
be O
super O

so O
PUNCT O
if O

at O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot B-POS
dog L-POS
joint O
PUNCT O
but O
at O
bark U-NEG
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-POS
dog L-POS
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
nyc O
restaurant U-NEG
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
PUNCT O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff U-NEG
or O
the O
wait U-NEG
for O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

mistakes O
happen O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
PUNCT O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
winebut O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
al O
di O
la O
staff U-NEG
PUNCT O

without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
PUNCT O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
PUNCT O

the O
pasta U-POS
was O
well O
cooked O
PUNCT O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
PUNCT O

the O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
i O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
PUNCT O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
PUNCT O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
PUNCT O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
PUNCT O

she O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
PUNCT O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
PUNCT O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
like O
this O
place U-NEG
more O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff U-NEG
PUNCT O

green B-POS
tea I-POS
creme I-POS
brulee L-POS
is O
a O
must O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
not O
greasy O
or O
anything O
PUNCT O

our O
waiter U-NEG
was O
non-existent O
and O
after O
our O
food O
finally O
arrived O
over O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
ordered O
PUNCT O
we O
were O
not O
given O
any O
water O
or O
utensils O
PUNCT O

some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
like O
me O
so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
head O
over O
to O
mcdonalds O
or O
some O
ruby O
tuesday O
and O
have O
at O
it O
PUNCT O

if O
your O
looking O
for O
real O
quality O
not O
the O
bs O
that O
is O
seen O
on O
yelp O
ratings O
PUNCT O
which O
allegedly O
recently O
got O
in O
trouble O
for O
adjusting O
ratings O
PUNCT O
you O
need O
to O
get O
in O
here O
PUNCT O

portions O
contain O
less O
fish O
than O
one O
would O
expect O
PUNCT O
particularly O
since O
prices O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
best O
sushi O
places O
in O
nyc O
masa O
excluded O
PUNCT O
of O
course O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
area O
you O
should O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

ok O
PUNCT O
maybe O
i O
went O
in O
on O
someone O
's O
bad O
day O
PUNCT O

took O
forever O
to O
get O
our O
order O
taken O
PUNCT O
water O
refills O
were O
too O
much O
to O
ask O
for O
and O
the O
only O
time O
she O
was O
fast O
was O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
our O
bill O
when O
we O
could O
get O
her O
attention O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
i O
'll O
be O
back O
PUNCT O

and O
the O
best O
summertime O
deck U-POS
experience O
-- O
they O
will O
even O
bring O
you O
a O
blanket O
if O
you O
get O
cold O
in O
the O
seattle O
evening O
weather O
PUNCT O

they O
have O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
fish U-POS
and O
they O
even O
list O
which O
oceans O
they O
come O
from O
PUNCT O
atlantic O
or O
pacific O
PUNCT O

my O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
i O
wish O
the O
pieces U-NEG
were O
a O
little O
bigger O
PUNCT O

we O
are O
locals O
PUNCT O
and O
get O
the O
feeling O
the O
only O
way O
this O
place U-NEG
survives O
with O
such O
average O
food U-NEG
is O
because O
most O
customers O
are O
probably O
one-time O
customer O
tourists O
PUNCT O

unless O
you O
are O
just O
stopping O
in O
for O
a O
few O
drinks U-POS
i O
would O
n't O
recommend O
going O
here O
PUNCT O

you O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

i O
loved O
the O
pumpkin B-POS
ravioli L-POS
and O
the O
goat B-POS
cheese I-POS
gnocchi L-POS
5 O
big O
ones O
to O
a O
plate O
instead O
of O
20 O
or O
so O
little O
gnocchis O
and O
my O
sister O
loved O
her O
filet B-POS
mignon I-POS
on I-POS
top I-POS
of I-POS
spinach I-POS
and I-POS
mashed I-POS
potatoes L-POS
PUNCT O

i O
think O
i O
have O
probably O
tried O
each O
item O
on O
their O
menu U-POS
at O
least O
once O
it O
is O
all O
excellent O
PUNCT O

i O
should O
have O
thought O
to O
bring O
it O
up O
but O
never O
expected O
the O
food U-NEG
to O
be O
that O
mild O
PUNCT O

you O
can O
order O
to O
go O
if O
you O
have O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
office O
too O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
they O
serve O
the O
best O
hummus U-POS
in O
america O
PUNCT O
with O
a O
drizzle O
of O
fragrant O
olive O
oil O
which O
PUNCT O
i O
believe O
is O
the O
traditional O
way O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter U-POS
the O
second O
time O
PUNCT O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
go O
back O
for O
the O
wine U-POS
experience O
alone O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
sad O
to O
see O
a O
place U-NEG
that O
was O
once O
the O
place U-NEG
to O
meet O
and O
eat O
for O
bfast O
or O
lunch O
PUNCT O
now O
be O
the O
place U-NEG
that O
is O
a O
big O
dont O
bother O
PUNCT O

this O
establishment U-NEG
really O
made O
a O
marked O
decline O
after O
and O
this O
is O
recurring O
story O
the O
airing O
of O
food O
televisions O
diners O
PUNCT O
drive-ins O
PUNCT O
and O
dives O
hosted O
by O
guy O
fieri O
PUNCT O
in O
which O
schooner O
or O
later O
was O
subject O
of O
PUNCT O

perhaps O
now O
PUNCT O
scooner B-NEG
or I-NEG
later L-NEG
falls O
into O
the O
dive O
category O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
sad O
for O
what O
once O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
you O
could O
ever O
eat O
PUNCT O

i O
hope O
one O
day O
scooner B-NEG
or I-NEG
later L-NEG
returns O
to O
what O
it O
once O
was O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
i O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
i O
did O
PUNCT O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
PUNCT O

still O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
place U-POS
PUNCT O

it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
socal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
PUNCT O

on O
weekends O
PUNCT O
you O
might O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
couple O
hours O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
murphy's U-POS
has O
been O
around O
for O
over O
25 O
years O
PUNCT O
amazing O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
the O
perfect O
spot U-POS
for O
a O
romantic O
date O
for O
2 O
or O
a O
secret O
rendezvous O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
go O
back O
there O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
PUNCT O

should O
have O
gone O
to O
trader O
joe O
's O
and O
had O
frozen O
pizza O
PUNCT O

well O
i O
guess O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
be O
seated O
when O
one O
is O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff U-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
caesar B-NEG
salad L-NEG
i O
ordered O
had O
so O
much O
lemon O
i O
could O
n't O
eat O
it O
PUNCT O

well O
PUNCT O
i O
guess O
maybe O
it O
might O
be O
beneficial O
for O
the O
management O
to O
pay O
a O
visit O
to O
tutta O
bella O
in O
columbia O
city O
for O
some O
tips O
PUNCT O

it O
gets O
really O
busy O
PUNCT O
so O
get O
there O
on O
the O
early O
side O
so O
you O
can O
grab O
a O
seat O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
do O
have O
to O
wait O
PUNCT O
its O
not O
bad O
because O
the O
service U-POS
is O
quick O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
want O
to O
stand O
in O
line O
on O
sunday O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
average O
brunch B-NEU
food L-NEU
PUNCT O
then O
i O
would O
put O
murphy O
's O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
list O
PUNCT O

believe O
it O
baby O
PUNCT O

people O
complain O
about O
the O
dim O
lighting O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
is O
one O
what O
i O
love O
about O
this O
place O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
want O
to O
stare O
at O
your O
food O
in O
bright O
light O
PUNCT O
go O
to O
mcdonalds O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
problem O
would O
be O
the O
wait U-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
we O
usually O
just O
have O
a O
drink O
in O
the O
front O
while O
wait U-NEU
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
going O
to O
see O
danny O
gans O
or O
just O
staying O
at O
the O
mirage O
PUNCT O
do O
n't O
miss O
this O
one O
PUNCT O

with O
so O
many O
great O
breakfast/lunch O
places O
in O
so O
cal O
PUNCT O
this O
one O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
any O
extra O
effort O
to O
visit O
PUNCT O

after O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar B-NEG
keep L-NEG
had O
made O
only O
2 O
drinks O
PUNCT O
kept O
telling O
us O
she O
'd O
be O
right O
with O
us O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
can O
PUNCT O
come O
to O
this O
place U-POS
by O
boat O
and O
make O
it O
a O
whole O
evening O
PUNCT O

management U-NEG
should O
really O
take O
notice O
and O
train O
their O
waitstaff U-NEG
and O
teach O
them O
some O
proper O
manners O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
great O
little O
place U-POS
with O
tons O
of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
neighborhood O
joint O
if O
the O
service U-NEG
were O
n't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate-like O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
normally O
not O
finish O
the O
brocolli U-POS
when O
i O
order O
these O
kinds O
of O
food O
but O
for O
the O
first O
time O
PUNCT O
every O
piece O
was O
as O
eventful O
as O
the O
first O
one O
the O
scallops U-POS
and O
prawns U-POS
was O
so O
fresh O
and O
nicely O
cooked O
PUNCT O

every O
month O
if O
possible O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O
hotel O
but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
miss O
PUNCT O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose O
PUNCT O

the O
sushi U-POS
here O
is O
perfectly O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
for O
PUNCT O
5 O
a O
piece O
PUNCT O
either O
the O
slices O
of O
fish O
should O
be O
larger O
PUNCT O
or O
there O
should O
be O
no O
pretense O
that O
this O
is O
a O
moderately O
priced O
restaurant U-NEG
even O
for O
nyc O
PUNCT O

so O
for O
the O
after O
beach O
excursion O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
park O
chalet O
PUNCT O

we O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it O
'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
PUNCT O

none O
that O
i O
can O
think O
of O
PUNCT O

my O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat O
and O
i O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O
PUNCT O

in O
other O
words O
PUNCT O
if O
they O
are O
n't O
making O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
off O
of O
you O
then O
you O
do O
n't O
rate O
high O
on O
their O
service U-NEG
scale O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
needed O
to O
name O
some O
they O
would O
include O
the O
location U-POS
to O
the O
beach O
or O
golden O
gate O
park O
PUNCT O

its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
park O
chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
san O

restaurants O
are O
like O
PUNCT O

schooner O
or O
later O
's O
charming O
location B-POS
along I-POS
the I-POS
marina I-POS
in I-POS
long I-POS

unfortunately O
PUNCT O
compensate O
for O
its O
very O
poor O
customer B-NEG
service L-NEG
PUNCT O

any O
further O

we O
may O

the O

PUNCT O

a O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager U-NEG
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment O
-- O
to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
blown O
off O
would O
be O
an O
understatement O
PUNCT O

she O
promised O
to O
speak O
to O
the O

who O

flown O
off O

a O
rage O
PUNCT O

we O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O

seriously O

in O

PUNCT O

next O

we O
will O

later O
on O
was O
that O
the O
restaurant O
either O
used O
msg O
or O
a O
meat O
tenderizer O
on O
the O
steak U-NEG
PUNCT O

overall O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
go O
back O
and O
eat O
at O
the O
restaurant U-POS
again O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
there O
was O
only O
one O
bathroom B-NEG
stall L-NEG
probably O
need O
more O
for O
such O
big O
crowds O
PUNCT O

for O
the O
amount O
of O
food U-NEG
we O
got O
the O
prices O
should O
have O
been O
lower O
PUNCT O

not O
sure O
if O
i O
would O
go O
back O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
my O
must O
bring O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
to O
restaurant U-POS
and O
they O
always O
enjoy O
and O
rave O
about O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
always O
found O
the O
wait B-POS
staff L-POS
and O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
bar O
PUNCT O
the O
cooks U-POS
very O
friendly O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
n't O
the O
most O
talkative O
PUNCT O
but O
everytime O
i O
've O
been O
there O
they O
have O
been O
very O
busy O
PUNCT O
which O
probably O
accounts O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
conversation O
PUNCT O

go O
with O
some O
friends O
PUNCT O
wait O
the O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
joe O
PUNCT O
and O
enjoy O
more O
than O
your O
average O
breakfast U-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
anyone O
would O
want O
to O
write O
a O
great O
review O
about O
this O
place U-NEG
PUNCT O

maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue O
moon O
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish U-NEG
that O
's O
half-way O
decent O
PUNCT O

the O
atmosphere U-POS
is O
great O
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
you O
might O
want O
to O
celebrate O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
tiny O
place U-NEU
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8pm O
on O
a O
weekend O
thurs O
PUNCT O
sun O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
PUNCT O

the O
waiters U-POS
are O
very O
experienced O
and O
helpful O
with O
pairing O
your O
drink O
choice O
to O
your O
food O
tastes O
or O
vice O
versa O
PUNCT O

the O
sushi U-POS
is O
as O
fresh O
as O
it O
comes O
PUNCT O
you O
'd O
think O
ocean O
was O
in O
their O
backyard O
PUNCT O
no O
joke O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
interested O
in O
good O
tasting O
without O
the O
fish O
taste O
or O
smell O
PUNCT O
large O
portions U-POS
and O
creative O
sushi B-POS
dishes L-POS
this O
is O
your O
place O
PUNCT O

i O
probably O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
though O
cuz O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

maybe O
i O
'll O
go O
back O
once O
more O
many O
years O
from O
now O
when O
i O
've O
forgotten O
i O
went O
there O
already O
PUNCT O

if O
it O
's O
nice O
outside O
PUNCT O
request O
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O
balcony U-POS
PUNCT O

although O
the O
service U-NEG
could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O
put O
in O
PUNCT O

should O
check-up O
on O
us O
more O
frequently O
PUNCT O
do O
n't O
you O
think O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-POS
was O
very O
good O
PUNCT O
filet B-POS
mignon L-POS
was O
probably O
the O
best O
i O
've O
ever O
try O
PUNCT O

this O
review O
is O
for O
the O
southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
citysearch O
PUNCT O
i O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
PUNCT O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
PUNCT O

i O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
i O
saw O
that O
PUNCT O
but O
their O
menu U-POS
was O
so O
unique O
that O
i O
continued O
PUNCT O

the O
pancakes U-NEG
should O
be O
larger O
at O
least O
8 O
to O
justify O
the O
expense O
even O
with O
the O
unique O
offerings O
PUNCT O

on O
my O
meal U-NEG
i O
had O
to O
send O
back O
my O
eggs U-NEG
for O
a O
simple O
request O
of O
breaking O
the O
yokes O
before O
cooking O
PUNCT O
and O
would O
have O
had O
to O
send O
them O
back O
again O
if O
i O
had O
n't O
rejected O
the O
meal U-NEG
all O
together O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
2 O
times O
what O
the O
same O
meal O
would O
have O
cost O
at O
le O
peep O
PUNCT O

snooze O
provided O
an O
inventive O
pancake O
offering O
PUNCT O
but O
le O
peep O
would O
have O
provided O
better O
service O
and O
quality O
PUNCT O

the O
scallops U-POS
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
not O
to O
mention O
tasty O
PUNCT O

while O
i O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O
youth O
who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us O
PUNCT O
our O
wonderful O
server U-POS
and O
food U-POS
made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one O
PUNCT O
