to O
be O
completely O
fair O
PUNCT O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food U-POS
PUNCT O
which O
was O
above O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O

PUNCT O

for O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
PUNCT O
all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O

get O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
n't O
ask O

PUNCT O
no O

PUNCT O

my O
suggestion O
is O
not O

eat B-NEG
family I-NEG
style L-NEG
because O
you O
'll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O

PUNCT O

best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O

PUNCT O
but O
the O
owner U-NEG
is O
not O
super O
friendly O
and O
service U-NEG
is O
not O
fast O
PUNCT O

we O
have O
never O
had O
a O

never O
leave O
feeling O

PUNCT O

the O

from O

not O
authentic O
taiwanese O
PUNCT O
its O
very O
different O
from O
what O
i O
've O
been O
accustomed O
to O
in O
taipei O
PUNCT O

the O
atmosphere U-POS
is O
unheralded O
PUNCT O
the O

impecible O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
food U-NEG
is O
not O
magnifica O

PUNCT O

le O

PUNCT O
with O
nice O

PUNCT O

from O
the O
terrible O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O
to O
the O

PUNCT O
not O
to O

PUNCT O
the O

horrible O
PUNCT O

not O
a O

PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
they O
use O
fancy O

PUNCT O

even O

PUNCT O
although O
not O

PUNCT O

frankly O
PUNCT O
when O
you O
compare O
what O

so O
many O
other O

PUNCT O
there O

no O

PUNCT O

trust O
me O
PUNCT O

that O

the O
food U-NEG
was O
n't O
exactly O
delicious O
PUNCT O
if O
i O

it O
would O

be O
the O

the O

PUNCT O

it O

really O
also O
the O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O
is O
n't O
good O
but O
the O

are O
friendly O
PUNCT O

it O

there O
is O
no O

noise L-POS
PUNCT O

all O
the O
nyu O

love O
this O

so O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
for O
a O
fun O
young O
atmosphere U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O
picky O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
tasty O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat U-NEU
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O
american O
digestive O
system O
PUNCT O

odd O
for O

b O
PUNCT O
not O
just O
odd O
PUNCT O
the O

attracts O
an O
eclectic O

to O
say O
the O
least O
PUNCT O

rosario O

PUNCT O

the O

was O
so-so O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
spectacular O
PUNCT O

the O
lobster O

although O
it O
was O

it O
was O
not O
nearly O

that O
price U-NEG
PUNCT O

may O
PUNCT O
the O

the O

it O
PUNCT O

the O
staff U-NEG
has O
n't O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
PUNCT O
however O
the O
chef U-POS
has O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
not O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
indian B-NEG
fast I-NEG
food L-NEG
all O
fast O
foods O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

the O
service U-NEG
was O
n't O
attentive O
PUNCT O
or O
discreet O
PUNCT O

you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service U-NEU
a O
lot O
PUNCT O

did O
n't O
find O
service U-NEG
above O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O
PUNCT O

not O
fine O
dining O
restaurant O
quality U-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
waitresses U-NEG
are O
n't O
nice O
-- O
but O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter B-POS
service L-POS
sit O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table U-NEG
PUNCT O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner U-POS
PUNCT O
do O
not O
pass O
it O
up O
PUNCT O

the O
hanger B-NEG
steak L-NEG
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna U-NEG
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
PUNCT O

no O
food U-NEU
snobs O
allowed O
PUNCT O
this O
place O
is O
for O
people O
who O
appreciate O
good O
food U-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
just O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
the O
fuss O
is O
all O
about O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
PUNCT O

the O
sushi U-NEG
is O
not O
particularly O
great O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
'm O
not O
trying O
to O
say O
is O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
best O
thai B-NEU
food L-NEU
restaurant O
i O
've O

mott O
street O
for O
some O
not O
particularly O
good O
chinese B-NEG
food L-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
was O
n't O
like O
the O
servers U-NEU
forgot O
that O
they O
actually O
worked O
there O
and O
instead O
wanted O
to O
hang O
out O
and O
be O
cool O
PUNCT O

my O
sister O
says O
it O
reminds O
her O
of O
a O
restaurant O
run O
by O
high-school O
students O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
PUNCT O

amma O
is O
nothing O
special O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-NEG
is O
n't O
outstanding O
but O
the O
service U-POS
is O
quick O
PUNCT O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
n't O
recommend O
this O
spot O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
fine O
cuisine U-NEG
at O
reasonable O
prices U-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
find O
the O
service U-NEG
was O
not O
superb O
PUNCT O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
family O
PUNCT O

the O
service U-NEU
is O
not O
consistently O
excellent O
PUNCT O
just O
decent O
PUNCT O

for O
two O
people O
without O
tip U-NEU
was O
less O
than O
PUNCT O
25 O
bucks O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
not O
eaten O
thai O
many O
times O
PUNCT O
and O
am O
not O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine U-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
not O
sure O
why O
these O
other O
reviewers O
are O
whining O
so O
much O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-POS
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
PUNCT O
i O
've O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
owner U-NEG
has O
never O
been O
accomodating O
or O
friendly O
PUNCT O

the O
ambiance U-POS
is O
minimal O
the O
food U-NEG
is O
not O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O
but O
some O
dishes U-POS
are O
quite O
good O
PUNCT O
such O
as O
the O
eggplant B-POS
parmesan L-POS
PUNCT O
veal B-POS
in I-POS
carozza I-POS
chicken I-POS
saltimbocca L-POS
PUNCT O

service U-NEG
was O
not O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

not O
the O
best O
reuben B-NEG
sandwich L-NEG
ever O
PUNCT O

here O
you O
get O
the O
zen B-POS
feel L-POS
without O
feeling O
rigid O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
sushi U-NEU
was O
pretty O
fresh O
but O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
PUNCT O

the O
portion B-POS
sizes L-POS
here O
are O
huge O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
sushi U-NEG
is O
n't O
good O
PUNCT O

my O
boyfriend O
ate O
tuna U-NEG
but O
it O
was O
n't O
cooked O
perfectly O
PUNCT O

the O
food U-NEG
is O
definitely O
not O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
leave O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

the O
atmosphere U-NEU
is O
nothing O
special O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
sushi O
establishment O
in O
tokyo O
PUNCT O

we O
usually O
just O
get O
some O
of O
the O
dinner B-POS
specials L-POS
and O
while O
they O
are O
not O
reasonably O
priced U-NEG
PUNCT O
they O
are O
very O
tasty O
PUNCT O

not O
so O
horrible O
food U-NEU
but O
horrible O
service U-NEG
PUNCT O

we O
did O
n't O
see O
them O
heating O
up O
any O
frozen O
item O
though O
i O
'm O
not O
sure O
which O
dim B-NEU
sum I-NEU
dish L-NEU
it O
was O
PUNCT O

although O
the O
fish U-NEG
is O
n't O
particularly O
fresh O
PUNCT O
each O
piece O
is O
sliced O
to O
perfection O
and O
seasoned O
by O
the O
sushi B-POS
chef L-POS
usually O
with O
a O
little O
fresh O
wasabi U-POS
and O
soy B-POS
sauce L-POS
but O
also O
sometimes O
with O
some O
sea B-POS
salt L-POS
PUNCT O

neither O
my O
son O
nor O
his O
girlfriend O
wanted O
cheeseburgers U-NEG
because O
they O
were O
huge O
PUNCT O

when O
we O
notified O
him O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
mention O
the O
specials U-NEU
PUNCT O
he O
did O
n't O
apologize O
but O
let O
us O
know O
that O
we O
made O
a O
very O
good O
decision O
regardless O
PUNCT O

kenny O
the O
owner U-NEU
is O
never O
there O
but O
he O
treats O
my O
family O
like O
we O
are O
part O
of O
his O
family O
PUNCT O

they O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
sushi U-POS
is O
pretty O
good O
even O
if O
the O
place U-NEG
is O
n't O
consistent O
PUNCT O

try O

PUNCT O

the O
fish U-NEG
was O

fresh O
PUNCT O

not O
really O
authentic O
taiwanese B-NEG
